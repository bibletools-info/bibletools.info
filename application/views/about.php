			<h3>History</h3><br>
			<p>BibleTools info was started in 2014 by an undergraduate student who wanted a simple way to find relevant resources to specific Bible verses. Initially, he did not expect the website to prove useful to many people besides a few friends, but the word spread and people from all over the globe started regularly using it. There's a wealth of information out there to provide explanations for difficult to understand Bible verses, but finding these in a timely manner can take painstaking effort. And though BibleTools will never be an end-all due to copyright restrictions, we hope it will continue to prove useful to many people as we continue to add additional resources.</p>
			<br><h3>Resources</h3><br>
			<p><strong>Ellen. G. White Writings</strong><br>Most of the quotes from the works of Ellen White were included based on the <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/2778/toc" target="_blank">EGW Scripture Index</a>. Some quotes may be manually added if they're found to be relevant to the verse.</p>
			<p><strong>Matthew Henry Concise Commentary</strong><br>A condensed version of the six volume set originally written in 1706. Matthew Henry was a nonconformist Puritan minister from England.</p>
			<p><strong>Albert Barnes Notes on the Whole Bible</strong><br>Barnes was an American, Presbyterian theologian whose 26 volume commentary set was published in the 1800s.</p>
			<p><strong>Adam Clarke Bible Commentary</strong><br>Clarke was a British Methodist theologian born around 1760. His theological views reflect that of John Wesley who opposed the Calvinistic perspective.</p>
