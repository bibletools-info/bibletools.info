John is but the penman employed by Christ to write out this Revelation for the benefit of his church. There is no doubt that the John here mentioned is the person of that name who was the beloved and highly favored one among the twelve apostles. He was evangelist and apostle, and the writer of the Gospel and epistles which bear his name. (See Clarke, Barnes, Kitto, Fond, and others.) To his previous titles he now adds that of prophet; for the Revelation is a prophecy. But the matter of this book is traced back to a still higher source. It is not only the Revelation of Jesus Christ, but it is the Revelation which God gave unto him. It comes, then, first, from the great fountain of all wisdom and truth, God the Father; by him it was communicated to Jesus Christ, the Son; and Christ sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 323.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 323.3</span></p>

Moses, in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.11606#11606" data-link="1965.11606">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>, tells us that “the secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which <em>are revealed</em> belong unto us and to our children forever.” The very title of the book, then, is a sufficient refutation of the popular opinion of to-day, that this book is among the hidden mysteries of God, and cannot be understood. Were this the case, it should bear some such title as “The Mystery,” or “The Hidden Book;” certainly not that of “The Revelation.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 324.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 324.1</span></p>

God says that it was given to show something to his servants; and yet many of the expounders of his word tell us that it does not show anything, because no man can understand it! as though God would undertake to make known to mankind some important truths, and yet fall into the worse than earthly folly of clothing them in language or in figures which human minds could not comprehend! as though he would command a person to behold some distant object, and then erect an impenetrable barrier between him and the object specified! or as though he would give his servants a light to guide them through the gloom of night, and yet throw over that light a pall so thick and heavy that not a ray of its brightness could penetrate the obscuring folds! How do they dishonor God who thus trifle with his word! No; the Revelation will accomplish the object for which it was given, and “his servants” will learn therefrom “the things which must shortly come to pass,” and which concern their eternal salvation.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 324.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 324.3</span></p>

What angel could appropriately be called Christ’s angel? May we not find an answer to this question in a significant passage in the prophecy of Daniel? In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44962#44962" data-link="1965.44962">Daniel 10:21</a>, an angel, which was doubtless Gabriel (see Daniel, chapters 9, 10, and 11:1), in making known some important truths to Daniel, said, “There is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.” Who Michael is we easily learn. Jude (verse 9) calls him the “archangel.” And Paul tells us that when the Lord descends from heaven, and the dead in Christ are raised, the voice of the archangel shall be heard. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.60408#60408" data-link="1965.60408">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>. And whose voice will be heard at that amazing hour when the dead are called to life? The Lord himself replies, “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear <em>his voice</em>” (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.53524#53524" data-link="1965.53524">John 5:28</a>); and the previous verse shows that the one here referred to, whose voice will then be heard, is the Son of man, or <em>Christ</em>. It is the voice of Christ, then, that calls the dead from their graves. That voice, Paul declares, is the voice of the archangel; and Jude says that the archangel is called Michael, the very personage mentioned in Daniel, and all referring to Christ. The statement in Daniel, then, is, that the truths to be revealed to Daniel were committed to Christ, and confined exclusively to him, and to an angel whose name was Gabriel. Similar to the work of communicating important truth to the “beloved prophet” is the work of Christ in the Revelation of communicating important truth to the “beloved disciple;” and who, in this work, can be <em>his</em> angel but he who was engaged with him in the former work, that is, the angel Gabriel? This fact will throw light on some points in this book, while it would also seem most appropriate that the same being who was employed to carry messages to the “beloved” prophet of the former dispensation, should perform the same office for him who corresponds to that prophet in the gospel age. (See on chapter 19:10.)</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 325.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 325.1</span></p>

What encouragement, then, have we for its study! And shall we say that it cannot be understood? Is a blessing offered for the study of a book which it can do us no good to study? Men may assert, with more pertness than piety, that “every age of declension is marked by an increase of commentaries on the Apocalypse,” or that “the study of the Revelation either finds or leaves a man mad;” but God has pronounced his blessing upon it, he has set the seal of his approbation to an earnest study of its marvelous pages; and with such encouragement from such a source, the child of God will be unmoved by a thousand feeble counterblasts from men.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 326.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 326.1</span></p>

It becomes more and more important, as we draw near the great consummation. On this point we offer the impressive thoughts of another: “The importance of studying the Apocalypse increases with the lapse of time. Here are ‘things which must shortly come to pass.’ Even when John bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw, the long period within which those successive scenes were to be realized was at hand. If proximity then constituted a motive for heeding those contents, how much more does it now! Every revolving century, every closing year, adds to the urgency with which attention is challenged to the concluding portion of Holy Writ. And does not that intensity of devotion to the present, which characterizes our times and our country, enhance the reasonableness of this claim? Never, surely, was there a period when some mighty counteracting power was more needed. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, duly studied, supplies an appropriate corrective influence. Would that all Christians might, in fullest measure, receive the blessing of ‘them that hear the words of this prophecy, and that keep the things which are written therein; for the time is at hand.’” — <em>Thompson’s Patmos</em>, pp. 28, 29.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 326.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 326.3</span></p>

We may confine ourselves to that western fraction of Asia known as Asia Minor, or we may include still less territory than that; for in even that small portion of Asia Minor where were situated the seven churches which are mentioned, and right in their very midst, there were other important churches. Colosse, to the Christians of which place Paul addressed his epistle to the Colossians, was but a slight distance from Laodicea. Miletus was nearer than any of the seven to Patmos, where John had his vision; and it was an important station for the church, as we may judge from the fact that Paul, during one of his stays there, sent for the elders of the church of Ephesus to meet him at that place. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.56371#56371" data-link="1965.56371">Acts 20:17-38</a>.

And Troas, where Paul spent a season with the disciples, and whence, having waited till the Sabbath was past, he started off upon his journey, was not far removed from Pergamos, named among the seven. It becomes, therefore, an interesting question to determine why seven of the churches of Asia Minor were selected as the ones to which the Revelation should be dedicated. Does what is said <em>of</em> the seven churches in chapter 1, and <em>to</em> them in chapters 2 and 3, have reference solely to the seven literal churches named, describing things only as they then and there existed, and portraying what was before them alone? We cannot so conclude, for the following reasons: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 327.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 327.3</span></p>

Only a small portion of the book could have personally concerned the seven churches, or any of the Christians of John’s day; for the events it brings to view were mostly so far in the future as to lie beyond the lifetime of the generation then living, or even the time during which those churches would continue; and consequently they could have no personal connection with them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 328.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 328.2</span></p>

The seven stars which the Son of man held in his right hand (verse 20), are declared to be the angels of the seven churches. The <em>angels</em> of the churches, doubtless all will agree, are the <em>ministers</em> of the churches. Their being held in the right hand of the Son of man denotes the upholding power, guidance, and protection vouchsafed to them. But there were only seven of them in his right hand. And are there only seven thus cared for by the great Master of assemblies? May not, rather, <em>all</em> the true ministers of the whole gospel age derive from this representation the consolation of knowing that they are upheld and guided by the right hand of the great Head of the church?

Again, John, looking into the Christian dispensation, saw only seven candlesticks, representing seven churches, in the midst of which stood the Son of man. The position of the Son of man in their midst must denote his presence with them, his watchcare over them, and his searching scrutiny of all their works. But does he thus take cognizance of only seven individual churches in this dispensation? May we not rather conclude that this scene represents his position in reference to all his churches during the gospel age? Then why were only seven mentioned? Seven, as used in the Scriptures, is a number denoting fulness and completeness, being, doubtless, a kind of memorial of the great facts of the first seven days of time, which gave the world the still used weekly cycle. Like the seven stars, the seven candlesticks must denote the whole of the things which they represent. The whole gospel church in seven divisions, or periods, must be symbolized by them; and hence the seven churches must be applied in the same manner.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 329.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 329.1</span></p>

And the following sentence adds intensity of meaning to the previous words: “And washed us from our sins in his own blood.” What love is this! “Greater love,” says the apostle, “hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” But Christ has commended his love to us, in that he died for us “while we were yet sinners.” But more than this — “Hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father.” From being leprous with sin, we are made clean in his sight; from being enemies, we are not only made friends, but raised to positions of honor and dignity. This cleansing, and this kingly and priestly exaltation — to what state do they pertain? to the present or the future? — Chiefly to the future; for it is then only that we shall enjoy these blessings in the highest degree. Then, after the atonement has been accomplished, we are absolutely free from our sins; before that time they are pardoned only on condition, and blotted out only by anticipation. But when the saints are permitted to sit with Christ on his throne, according to the promise to the victorious Laodiceans, when they take the kingdom under the whole heaven and reign forever and ever, they will be kings in a sense that they never can be in this present state. Yet enough is true of our present condition to make this cheering language appropriate in the Christian’s present song of joy; for here we are permitted to say that <em>we have</em> redemption through his blood, though that redemption is not yet given, and that <em>we have</em> eternal life, though that life is still in the hands of the Son, to be brought unto us at his appearing; and it is still true, as it was in the days of John and Peter, that God designs his people in this world to be unto him a chosen generation, a royal (kingly) priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62032#62032" data-link="1965.62032">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62773#62773" data-link="1965.62773">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44789#44789" data-link="1965.44789">Daniel 7:18, 27</a>.

But it may be asked, Does not the word <em>Lord</em> denote that it was Christ? On this point Barnes has the following note: “Many MSS. instead of ‘Lord,’ κύριος, read ‘God,’ θεός, and this reading is adopted by Griesbach, Tittman, and Hahn, and is now regarded as the correct reading.” Bloomfield supplies the word <em>God</em>, and marks the words “the beginning and the ending” as an interpolation.

Does John really mean to say that Christians in the present state are in the kingdom of Christ, or in other words, that in his day Christ’s kingdom had already been set up? If this language has any reference to the present state, it must be in a very limited and accommodated sense. Those who take the ground that it has its application here, usually refer to <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62032#62032" data-link="1965.62032">1 Peter 2:9</a> to prove the existence of a kingdom in the present state, and to show its nature. But, as was remarked on verse 6, the literal reign of the saints is yet future. It is <em>through</em> much tribulation that we are to <em>enter</em> into the kingdom of God. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.55951#55951" data-link="1965.55951">Acts 14:22</a>. But when the kingdom is entered, the tribulation is done. The tribulation and the kingdom do not exist contemporaneously. Murdock’s translation of the Syriac of this verse omits the word <em>kingdom</em>, and reads as follows: “I John, your brother, and partaker with you in the affliction and suffering that are in Jesus the Messiah.” Wakefield translates: “I John, your brother, and sharer with you in enduring the affliction of the kingdom of Jesus Christ.” Bloomfield says that by the words <em>tribulation</em> and <em>patience</em> “are denoted afflictions and troubles to be endured for the sake, and in the cause of Christ; and βασιλείᾳ [kingdom] intimates that he is to be partaker with them in the kingdom prepared for them.” He says that “the best comment on this passage is <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.60863#60863" data-link="1965.60863">2 Timothy 2:12</a>,” which reads: “If we suffer, we <em>shall also</em> reign with him.” From all which we may safely conclude that though there is a kingdom of grace in the present state, the kingdom to which John alluded is the future kingdom of glory, and the suffering and patience are preparatory to its enjoyment.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 335.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 335.5</span></p>

It is about eight miles in length, one in breadth, and eighteen in circumference. Its present name is Patino or Patmosa. The coast is high, and consists of a succession of capes, which form many ports. The only one now in use is a deep bay sheltered by high mountains on every side but one, where it is protected by a projecting cape. The town attached to this port is situated upon a high, rocky mountain rising immediately from the sea, and is the only inhabited site of the island. About half way up the mountain on which this town is built, there is shown a natural grotto in the rock, where tradition will have it that John had his vision and wrote the Revelation. On account of the stern and desolate character of this island, it was used, under the Roman empire, as a place of banishment, which accounts for the exile of John thither. The banishment of the apostle took place about the year A. D. 94, as is generally supposed, under the emperor Domitian; and from this fact the date assigned to the writing of the Revelation is A. D. 95 or 96.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 336.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 336.1</span></p>

The tyrant Domitian, who was then invested with the imperial purple of Rome, more eminent for his vices than even for his civil position, quailed before this aged but dauntless apostle. He dared not permit the promulgation of his pure gospel within the bounds of his kingdom. He exiled him to lonely Patmos, where, if anywhere this side of death, he might be said to be out of the world. Having confined him to that barren spot, and to the cruel labor of the mines, the emperor doubtless thought that this preacher of righteousness was finally disposed of, and that the world would hear no more of him. So, doubtless, thought the persecutors of John Bunyan when they had shut him up in Bedford jail. But when man thinks he has buried the truth in eternal oblivion, the Lord gives it a resurrection in tenfold glory and power. From Bunyan’s dark and narrow cell there blazed forth a spiritual light, which, next to the Bible itself, has built up the interests of the gospel; and from the barren Isle of Patmos, where Domitian thought he had forever extinguished at least one torch of truth, there arose the most magnificent revelation of all the sacred canon, to shed its divine luster over the whole Christian world till the end of time. And how many will revere the name of the beloved disciple, and hang with delight upon his enrapturing visions of heavenly glory, who will never learn the name of the monster who caused his banishment. Verily, those words of the Scriptures are sometimes applicable, even to the present life, which declare that “the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance,” but “the name of the wicked shall rot.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 337.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 337.1</span></p>

The writer, the place where it was written, and the day upon which it was dated, have each a real existence, and not merely a symbolical or mystical one. But if we say that the day means the gospel dispensation, we give it a symbolical or mystical meaning, which is not admissible. Besides, this position involves the absurdity of making John say, sixty-five years after the death of Christ, that the vision which he records was seen by him in the gospel dispensation, as though any Christian could possibly be ignorant of that fact!</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 338.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 338.4</span></p>

The second position, that it is the day of Judgment, cannot be correct; for while John might have had a vision <em>concerning</em> the day of Judgment, he could not have had one <em>on</em> that day when it is yet future. The word translated <em>on</em> is ἐν<em> </em>(<em>en</em>), and is defined by Robinson when relating to time, as follows: “Time <em>when</em>; a definite point or period, <em>in</em>, <em>during</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>at</em>, which anything takes place.” It never means <em>about</em> or <em>concerning</em>. Hence they who refer it to the Judgment day either contradict the language used, making it mean <em>concerning</em> instead of <em>on</em>, or they make John state a strange falsehood, by saying that he had a vision upon the Isle of Patmos, nearly eighteen hundred years ago, <em>on</em> the day of Judgment which is yet future!</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 339.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 339.1</span></p>

The third view is that by “Lord’s day” is meant the first day of the week, a view by far the most generally entertained. On this we inquire for the proof. What evidence have we for this assertion? The text itself does not define the term Lord’s day; hence if it means the first day of the week we must look elsewhere in the Bible for the proof that that day of the week is ever so designated. The only other inspired writers who speak of the first day at all, are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Paul; and they speak of it simply as “the first day of the week.” They never speak of it in a manner to distinguish it above any other of the six working days. And this is the more remarkable, viewed from the popular standpoint, as three of them speak of it at the very time when it is said to have become the Lord’s day by the resurrection of the Lord upon it, and two of them mention it some thirty years after that event.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 339.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 339.2</span></p>

It cannot be found. But we have proof of just the contrary. (See History of the Sabbath, by J. N. Andrews, published at the <em>Review</em> Office, Battle Creek, Mich.) If this was the universal designation of the first day at the time the Revelation was written, the same writer would most assuredly call it so in all his subsequent writings. But John wrote the Gospel <em>after</em> he wrote the Revelation, and yet in that Gospel he calls the first day of the week, not Lord’s day, but simply “first day of the week.” For proof that the Gospel was written at a period subsequent to the Revelation, the reader is referred to such standard authorities as the Religious Encyclopedia, Barnes’s Notes (Gospels), Bible Dictionaries, Cottage Bible, Domestic Bible, Mine Explored, Union Bible Dictionary, Comprehensive Bible, Paragraph Bible, Bloomfield, Dr. Hales, Horne, Nevins, and Olshausen.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 339.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 339.3</span></p>

Neither of them has ever placed any blessing upon it, or attached any sanctity to it. If it was to be called the Lord’s day from the fact of Christ’s resurrection upon it, Inspiration would doubtless have somewhere so informed us. But there are other events equally essential to the plan of salvation, as, for instance, the crucifixion and the ascension; and in the absence of all instruction upon the point, why not call the day upon which either of these occurred, the Lord’s day, as well as the day upon which he rose from the dead?</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 340.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 340.1</span></p>

The three positions already examined having been disproved, the fourth — that by Lord’s day is meant the Sabbath of the Lord — now demands attention. And this of itself is susceptible of the clearest proof. 1. When God gave to man in the beginning six days of the week for labor, he expressly reserved the seventh day to himself, placed his blessing upon it, and claimed it as his holy day. 2. Moses told Israel in the wilderness of Sin on the sixth day of the week, “To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.” We come to Sinai, where the great Lawgiver proclaimed his moral precepts in awful grandeur; and in that supreme code he thus lays claim to his hallowed day: “The seventh day is the Sabbath <em>of the Lord thy God</em>: ... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” By the prophet Isaiah, about eight hundred years later, God spoke as follows: “If thou turn away thy foot from <em>the</em> Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, ... then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord,” etc. We come down to New-Testament times, and He who is one with the Father declares expressly, “The Son of man is <em>Lord</em> also of the Sabbath.” Can any man deny that that day is the <em>Lord’s day</em>, of which he has emphatically declared that he is the <em>Lord</em>? Thus we see that whether it be the Father or the Son whose title is involved, no other day can be called the Lord’s day but the Sabbath of the great Creator.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 340.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 340.2</span></p>

There is in this dispensation one day distinguished above the other days of the week as the Lord’s day. How completely does this great fact disprove the claim put forth by some that there is no Sabbath in this dispensation, but that all days are alike. And by calling it the Lord’s day, the apostle has given us, near the close of the first century, apostolic sanction for the observance of the only day which can be called the Lord’s day, which is the seventh day of the week.

Some of them are ingenious, but they are not now considered sufficient to support such a theory.

Those early Christians had received the doctrine of Christ in its purity. They enjoyed the benefits and blessings of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. They were noted for works, labor, and patience. In faithfulness to the pure principles taught by Christ, they could not bear those that were evil, and they tried false apostles, searched out their true characters, and found them liars.

The charge here is not that of falling from grace, nor that love is extinguished, but diminished. No zeal, no suffering can atone for the want of first love.” — <em>Thompson</em>. The time never should come in a Christian’s experience, when, if he were asked to mention the period of his greatest love to Christ, he would not say, The present moment. But if such a time does come, then should he remember from whence he is fallen, meditate upon it, take time for it, carefully call up the state of his former acceptance with God, and then hasten to repent, and retrace his steps to that desirable position.

The removing of the candlestick would denote the taking away from them of the light and privileges of the gospel, and committing them to other hands, unless they should better fulfill the responsibilities of the trust committed to them. But it may be asked on the view that these messages are prophetic, if the candlestick would not be removed anyway, whether they repented or not, as that church was succeeded by the next, to occupy the next period, and if this is not an objection against regarding these churches as prophetic. Answer: The expiration of the period covered by any church is not the removal of the candlestick of that church. The removal of their candlestick would be taking away from them privileges which they might and should longer enjoy. It would be the rejection of them on the part of Christ as his representatives, to bear the light of his truth and gospel before the world. And this threatening would be just as applicable to individuals as to the church as a body. How many who professed Christianity during that period thus came short and were rejected, we know not; doubtless many. And thus things would go on, some remaining steadfast, some backsliding and becoming no longer light-bearers in the world, new converts meanwhile filling up the vacancies made by death and apostasy, until the church reaches a new era in her experience, marked off as another period in her history, and covered by another message.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 348.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 348.1</span></p>

If there is anything of which he approves, he mentions that first. And in this message to the church of Ephesus, having first mentioned their commendable traits and then their failures, as if unwilling to pass by any of their good qualities he mentions this, that they hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which he also hated. In verse 15 the doctrines of the same characters are condemned. It appears that they were a class of persons whose deeds and doctrines were alike abominable in the sight of Heaven. Their origin is involved in some doubt. Some say that they sprang from Nicolas of Antioch, one of the seven deacons (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.55283#55283" data-link="1965.55283">Acts 6:5</a>); some, that they only attribute their origin to him to gain the prestige of his name; and others, that the sect took its name from one Nicolas of a later date, which is probably the nearest correct. Concerning their doctrines and practices, there seems to be a general agreement that they held to a community of wives, regarded adultery and fornication as things indifferent, and permitted the eating of things offered to idols.

Where is this paradise? Answer: In the third heaven. Paul writes, in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59188#59188" data-link="1965.59188">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, that he knew a man (referring to himself) caught up to the third heaven. In verse 4 he calls the same place “paradise,” leaving only one conclusion to be drawn, which is, that paradise is in the third heaven. In this paradise, it seems, is the tree of life. There is but one tree of life brought to view in the Bible. It is mentioned six times, three times in Genesis, and three times in the Revelation; but it is used every time with the definite article <em>the</em>. It is <em>the</em> tree of life in the first book of the Bible, <em>the</em> tree of life in the last; <em>the</em> tree of life in the “paradise” (Septuagint) in Eden at the beginning, and <em>the</em> tree of life in the paradise of which John now speaks, in heaven above. But if there is but one tree, and that was at first upon earth, it may be asked how it has now come to be in heaven. And the answer would be that it must have been taken up, or translated, to the paradise above. There is no possible way that the same identical body which is situated in one place can be located in another, but by being transported bodily thither. And that the tree of life and paradise have been removed from earth to heaven, besides the necessary inference from this argument, there is very good reason to believe.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 349.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 349.3</span></p>

He says (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57076#57076" data-link="1965.57076">Romans 2:28, 29</a>): “For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew [in the true Christian sense] which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.” Again he says (chapter 9:6, 7): “For they are not all Israel which are of Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children.” In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59405#59405" data-link="1965.59405">Galatians 3:28, 29</a>, Paul further tells us that in Christ there are no such outward distinctions as Jew or Greek; but if we are Christ’s, then are we <em>Abraham’s seed</em> (in the true sense), and <em>heirs</em> according to the promise. To say, as some do, that the term Jew is never applied to Christians, is to contradict all these inspired declarations of Paul’s, and the testimony of the faithful and true Witness to the Smyrnian church.

It would be difficult to make an application of this language on the ground that these messages are not prophetic; for in that case only ten literal days could be meant; and it would not seem probable that a persecution of only ten days, on only a single church, would be made a matter of prophecy; and no mention of any such case of limited persecution can be found. Again, apply this persecution to any of the notable persecutions of that period, and how could it be spoken of as the fate of one church alone?

Although this church lived at a time when Satan was especially at work, it was their duty to keep themselves pure from the leaven of his evil doctrines. Hence they were censured for harboring among them those who held the doctrines of Balaam and the Nicolaitanes. (See remarks on the Nicolaitanes, verse 6.) What the doctrine of Balaam was, is here partially revealed. He taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel. (See a full account of his work and its results in Numbers, chapters 22-25 and 31:13-16.) It appears that Balaam desired to curse Israel for the sake of the rich reward which Balak offered him for so doing. But not being permitted by the Lord to curse them, he resolved to accomplish essentially the same thing, though in a different way. He therefore counseled Balak to seduce them, by means of the females of Moab, to participate in the celebration of the rights of idolatry, and all its licentious accompaniments. The plan succeeded. The abominations of idolatry spread through the camp of Israel, the curse of God was called down upon them by their sins, and there fell by the plague twenty-four thousand persons.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 356.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 356.1</span></p>

Most commentators apply the manna, white stone, and new name, to spiritual blessings to be enjoyed in this life; but, like all the other promises to the overcomer, this one doubtless refers wholly to the future, and is to be given when the time comes that the saints are to be rewarded.

In primitive times, when traveling was rendered difficult from want of places of public entertainment, hospitality was exercised by private individuals to a very great extent, of which, indeed, we find frequent traces in all history, and in none more than the Old Testament. Persons who partook of this hospitality, and those who practiced it, frequently contracted habits of friendship and regard for each other, and it became a well-established custom among the Greeks and Romans to provide their guests with some particular mark, which was handed down from father to son, and insured hospitality and kind treatment whenever it was presented. This mark was usually a small stone or pebble, cut in half, upon the halves of which the host and the guest mutually inscribed their names, and then interchanged with each other. The production of this tessera was quite sufficient to insure friendship for themselves or descendants whenever they traveled again in the same direction, while it is evident that these stones required to be privately kept, and the names written upon them carefully concealed, lest others should obtain the privileges instead of the persons for whom they were intended.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 357.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 357.1</span></p>

This promise will be explained by the following facts and scriptures: (1) The nations are to be given by the Father into the hands of Christ, to be ruled with a rod of iron, and dashed in pieces like a potter’s vessel (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.28408#28408" data-link="1965.28408">Psalms 2:8, 9</a>); (2) Associated with Christ when he thus enters upon his own work of power and judgment, are to be his saints (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62773#62773" data-link="1965.62773">Revelation 3:21</a>); (3) They are to reign with him in this capacity for one thousand years (chapter 20:4); (4) During this period, the degree of judgment upon wicked men and evil angels is determined (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.58055#58055" data-link="1965.58055">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3</a>); (5) At the end of the one thousand years, they have the honor of sharing with Christ in the execution of the sentence written. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.33437#33437" data-link="1965.33437">Psalms 149:9</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 361.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 361.4</span></p>

But when the day star shall arise in their hearts, or the morning star be given to the overcomers, they will be taken into so close a relationship to Christ that their hearts will be fully illuminated with his Spirit, and they will walk in his light. Then they will no longer need the sure word of prophecy, which now shines as a light in a dark place.

The message applies to a period when that great event is impending; and in this we have most indubitable evidence of the prophetic nature of these messages. What is said of the first three churches contains no allusion to the second coming of Christ, from the fact that they do not cover a period during which that event could be Scripturally expected. But we come down to the Thyatiran church, beyond which only three comparatively brief stages of the church appear before the end, and, as though then the time had come when this great hope was just beginning to dawn upon the church, the mind is carried forward to it by a single allusion: “Hold fast till I come.” We come down to the next state of the church, the Sardis, the church which occupies a position still nearer that event, and the great proclamation is brought to view which was to herald it, and the duty of watching enjoined upon the church: “If thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief.” We reach the Philadelphian church, still further down in the stream of time, and the nearness of the same great event then leads Him who “is holy and true” to utter the stirring declaration, “Behold, I come quickly.” How evident is it from all this that these churches occupy positions successively nearer the great day of the Lord, as in each succeeding one, and in a continually increasing ratio, this great event is made more and more prominent, and is more definitely and impressively urged upon the attention of the church. Here they see indeed the day approaching. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61520#61520" data-link="1965.61520">Hebrews 10:25</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 369.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 369.1</span></p>

And though the description of their condition which he gives to the indifferent Laodiceans is fearful and startling, nevertheless it cannot be denied; for the Witness is “faithful and true.” Moreover, he is “the beginning of the creation of God.” Some understand by this language that Christ was the first created being, dating his existence anterior to that of any other created being or thing, next to the self-existent and eternal God. But the language does not necessarily imply that he was created; for the words, “the beginning of the creation,” may simply signify that the work of creation, strictly speaking, was begun by him. “Without him was not anything made.” Others, however, and more properly we think, take the word ἀρχὴ to mean the “agent” or “efficient cause,” which is one of the definitions of the word, understanding that Christ is the agent through whom God has created all things, but that he himself came into existence in a different manner, as he is called “the only begotten” of the Father. It would seem utterly inappropriate to apply this expression to any being created in the ordinary sense of that term.

It is important to determine what condition they each denote, in order to guard against wrong conclusions. Three conditions of spiritual life which pertain to the church, not to the world, are to be considered. What the term <em>hot</em> means it is not difficult to conceive. The mind at once calls Up a state of intense fervency and zeal, when all the affections, raised to the highest pitch, are drawn out for God and his cause, and manifest themselves in corresponding works. To be lukewarm is to lack this zeal, to be in a state in which heart and earnestness are wanting; in which there is no self-denial that costs anything, no cross-bearing that is felt, no determined witnessing for Christ, and no valiant aggression that keeps sinews strained and armor bright; and, worst of all, it implies entire <em>satisfaction</em> with that condition. But to be cold — what is that? Does it denote a state of corruption, wickedness, and sin, such as characterizes the world of unbelievers? We cannot so regard it, for the following reasons: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 372.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 372.1</span></p>

The threat of rejection in verse 16 is <em>because</em> they are <em>neither</em> cold nor hot. As much as to say that if they were <em>either</em> cold or hot, they would not be rejected.

Hence such cannot be its meaning.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 372.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 372.4</span></p>

Heat and cold are preferable to lukewarmness. But what kind of a spiritual state is denoted by the term <em>cold</em>? We may remark first that it is a state of <em>feeling</em>. In this respect it is superior to lukewarmness, which is a state of comparative insensibility, indifference, and supreme self-satisfaction. To be hot is also to be in a state of feeling. And as hot denotes joyous fervency, and a lively exercise of all the affections, with a heart buoyant with the sensible presence and love of God, so by cold would seem to be denoted a spiritual condition characterized by a destitution of these traits, yet one in which the individual <em>feels</em> such destitution, and longs to recover his lost treasures. This state is well expressed by the language of Job, “O that I knew where I might find him!” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.27324#27324" data-link="1965.27324">Job 23:3</a>. In this state there is not indifference, nor is there content; but there is a sense of coldness, unfitness, and discomfort, and a groping and seeking after something better. There is hope of a person in this condition. What a man feels that he lacks and wants, he will earnestly strive to obtain. The most discouraging feature of the lukewarm is that they are conscious of no lack, and feel that they have need of nothing. Hence it is easy to see why our Lord should prefer to behold his church in a state of comfortless coldness, rather than in a state of comfortable, easy, indifferent lukewarmness. Cold, a person will not long remain. His efforts will soon lead him to the fervid state. But lukewarm, there is danger of his remaining till the faithful and true Witness is obliged to reject him as a nauseous and loathsome thing.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 373.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 373.1</span></p>

It shows, too, where they can obtain those things in which they are so fearfully poor; it brings before them the necessity of speedily obtaining them. The case is so urgent that our great Advocate in the court above sends us special counsel on the point; and the fact that he who has condescended to point out our lack, and counsel us to buy, is the one who has these things to bestow, and invites us to come to him for them, is the best possible guarantee that our application will be respected, and our requests granted.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 374.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 374.2</span></p>

Figuratively, it must denote that which constitutes spiritual riches. What grace, then, is represented by the gold, or, rather, what graces? for doubtless no one single grace can be said to answer to the full import of that term. The Lord said to the church of Smyrna that he knew their poverty, but they were rich; and the testimony shows that their riches consisted of that which was finally to put them in possession of a crown of life. Says James, “Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world <em>rich in faith</em>; and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?” “Faith,” says Paul, “is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” To be “rich toward God,” — rich in the spiritual sense, — is to have a clear title to the promises, — to be an heir of that inheritance which is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us. “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59407#59407" data-link="1965.59407">Galatians 3:29</a>. And how do we obtain this heirship? — In the same way that Abraham obtained the promise; that is, through faith. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57168#57168" data-link="1965.57168">Romans 4:13, 14</a>. No wonder, then, that Paul should devote an entire chapter in Hebrews (chapter 11) to this important subject, setting forth the mighty achievements that have been accomplished, and the precious promises that have been obtained, through faith; and that he should, in the first verse of the next chapter, as the grand conclusion to his argument, exhort Christians to lay aside every weight, and the sin (of unbelief) that so easily besets them. Nothing will sooner dry up the springs of spirituality, and sink us into utter poverty in reference to the things of the kingdom of God, than to let faith go out and unbelief come in. For faith must enter into every action that is pleasing in his sight; and in coming to him, the first thing is to believe that he is; and it is through faith, as the chief agent under the grace which is the gift of God, that we are to be saved. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61561#61561" data-link="1965.61561">Hebrews 11:6</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59625#59625" data-link="1965.59625">Ephesians 2:8</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 375.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 375.1</span></p>

But if, as already remarked, no one grace can answer to the full import of the term <em>gold</em>, so, doubtless, other things are included with faith. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for,” says Paul. Hence hope is an inseparable accompaniment of faith. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61551#61551" data-link="1965.61551">Hebrews 11:1</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57382#57382" data-link="1965.57382">Romans 8:24, 25</a>.

In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.55669#55669" data-link="1965.55669">Acts 10:38</a> we read that “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.” And the same writer through whom came this Revelation from Jesus Christ, wrote to the church in his first epistle (chapter 2:20) as follows: “But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.” In verse 27 he enlarges upon this point thus: “But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.” By referring to his Gospel, it is found that the work which he here sets forth as accomplished by the anointing is exactly the same that he there attributes to the Holy Spirit. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.54445#54445" data-link="1965.54445">John 14:26</a>: “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” (See also <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.54537#54537" data-link="1965.54537">John 16:13</a>.)</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 376.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 376.2</span></p>

But how is it possible that a people lacking these things should think themselves rich and increased with goods? A plausible inference may here be drawn, which is perhaps also a necessary one, as there is room for no other. It will be observed that no fault is found with the Laodiceans on account of the doctrines they hold. They are not accused of harboring any Jezebel in their midst, or of countenancing the doctrines of Balaam or the Nicolaitanes. So far as we can learn from the address to them, their belief is correct, and their theory sound. The inference therefore is that having a correct theory, therewith they are content. They are satisfied with a correct form of doctrine without its power. Having received light concerning the closing events of this dispensation, and having a correct theoretical knowledge of the truths that pertain to the last generation of men, they are inclined to rest in this to the neglect of the spiritual part of religion. It is by their actions, doubtless, not by their words, that they say they are rich, and increased with goods. Having so much light and so much truth, what can they want besides? And if, with a commendable tenacity, they defend the theory, and in the letter, so far as their outward life is concerned, conform to the increasing light upon the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, is not their righteousness complete? Rich, and increased with goods, and needing nothing! Here is their failure. Their whole being should cry out for the spirit, the zeal, the fervency, the life, the power, of a living Christianity, and their righteousness should consist in a swallowing up of self and all its works in the merits of their Redeemer.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 377.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 377.1</span></p>

As all need chastisement in some measure, they in some measure receive it, and thus have proof of the Saviour’s attachment. This is a hard lesson to learn, and believers are dull scholars; yet here and throughout God’s word and providence it stands, that trials are his benedictions, and that no child escapes the rod. The incorrigibly misshapen and coarse-grained blocks are rejected, while those chosen for the glorious structure are subjected to the chisel and the hammer. There is no cluster on the true vine but must pass through the winepress. ‘For myself,’ said an old divine under affliction, ‘for myself, I bless God I have observed and felt so much mercy in this angry dispensation of God that I am almost transported. I am, sure, highly pleased with thinking how infinitely sweet his mercies are, when his judgments are so gracious.’ In view, then, of the origin and design of the chastisements you receive, ‘Be zealous and repent.’ Lose no time; lose not a blow of the rod, but repent at once.

Notwithstanding their offensive attitude, their unlovely character, such is his love to their souls that he humbles himself to solicit the privilege of making them blessed. ‘Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.’ Why does he? Not because he is without home elsewhere. Among the mansions in his Father’s house there is not one entrance closed to him. He is the life of every heart, the light in every eye, the song on every tongue, in glory. But he goes round from door to door in Laodicea. He stands at each, and knocks, because he came to seek and to save that which is lost, because he cannot give up the purpose of communicating eternal life to as many as the Father has given him, and because he cannot become known to the inmate unless the door be opened and a welcome given him. Have you bought a piece of ground? have you bought five yoke of oxen? is your hat in your hand, and do you pray to be excused? He knocks and knocks. But you cannot receive company at present; you are worn out with labor; you have wheeled round the sofa; you are making yourself comfortable, and send word that you are engaged. He knocks and knocks. ... It is the hour for church prayer-meeting or for monthly concert; there is opportunity to pay a Christian visit to an individual or a family; but you move not. ... Oh, nauseous lukewarmness! Oh, fatal worldliness! The Lord of glory comes all the way from his celestial palace — comes in poverty, in sweat, in blood — comes to the door of a professed friend, who owes all to him, and cannot get in! — comes to rescue a man whose house is on fire, and he will not admit him! Oh, the hight, the depth, of Jesus Christ’s forbearance! Even the heathen Publius received Paul, and lodged him three days courteously.

And the word <em>if</em> implies that some will not hear. Though he stands and knocks and entreats till his locks are wet with the dews of night, yet some will close their ears to his tender entreaties. But it is not enough simply to hear. We must hear, and open the door. And many who at first hear the voice, and for a time feel inclined to heed, will doubtless, alas! fail in the end to do that which is necessary to secure to themselves the communion of the heavenly Guest. Reader, are your ears open to the entreaties which the Saviour directs to you? Is the sound of his voice a welcome sound? Will you heed it? Will you open the door and let him in? Or is the door of your heart held fast by heaps of this world’s rubbish, which you are unwilling to remove? Remember that the Lord of life never forces an entrance. He condescends to come and knock, and seek admittance; but he takes up his abode in those hearts only where he is then a welcome and invited guest.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 379.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 379.1</span></p>

No common degree of union, no ordinary blessing, no usual privilege, is denoted by this language. Who, under such tender entreaty and so gracious a promise, can remain indifferent? Nor are we required to furnish the table for this exalted Guest. This he does himself, not with the gross nutriment of earth, but with viands from his own heavenly storehouse. Here he sets before us foretastes of the glory soon to be revealed. Here he gives us earnests of our future inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and fadeth not away.

This shows that the blessings included in that promise are to be enjoyed in this probationary state. And now, superadded to all these, is the promise to the overcomer: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” Here the promises of the Lord culminate. From being at first rebellious, and then fallen, degraded, and polluted, man is brought by the work of the Redeemer back into reconciliation with God, cleansed from his pollutions, redeemed from the fall, made immortal, and finally raised to a seat upon the very throne of his Saviour. Honor and exaltation could go no farther. Human minds cannot conceive that state, human language cannot describe it. We can only labor on till, if overcomers at last, we shall “know what it is to be there.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 380.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 380.2</span></p>

We learn by this that Christ reigns consecutively upon two thrones. One is the throne of his Father, the other is his own throne. He declares in this verse that he has overcome, and is now set down with his Father in his throne. He is now associated with the Father in the throne of universal dominion, placed at his right hand, far above all principality, power, might, and dominion. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59602#59602" data-link="1965.59602">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>, etc. While in this position, he is a priest-king. He is a priest, “a minister of the sanctuary;” but at the same time he is “on the right hand of the <em>throne</em> of the Majesty in the heavens.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61388#61388" data-link="1965.61388">Hebrews 8:1, 2</a>. This position and work of our Lord was thus predicted by the prophet Zechariah: “And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts [God], saying, Behold the man whose name is the Branch [Christ]; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord. ... And he [Christ] shall sit and rule upon his [God’s] throne; and he [Christ] shall be a priest upon his [God’s] throne; and the counsel of peace [in the sacrifice and priestly work of Christ in behalf of repenting man] shall be between them both.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.46876#46876" data-link="1965.46876">Zechariah 6:12, 13</a>. But the time is coming when he is to change his position, and, leaving the throne of his Father, take his own throne; and this must be when the time comes for the reward of the overcomers; for when they enter upon their reward, they are to sit with Christ on his throne, as he has overcome, and is now seated with the Father upon his throne. This change in the position of Christ is set forth by Paul in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.58610#58610" data-link="1965.58610">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</a>, as follows: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 381.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 381.1</span></p>

He delivers up this kingdom at the end of this dispensation, when the time comes for him to take his own throne. After this, he reigns on the throne of his father David, and is subject only to God, who still retains his position upon the throne of universal dominion. In this reign of Christ the saints participate. “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.” “And they lived,” says John, dating from the first resurrection (chapter 20:4), “and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” This we understand to be a special reign, or for a special purpose, as will be noticed in that chapter; for the actual reign of the saints is to be “forever and ever.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44789#44789" data-link="1965.44789">Daniel 7:18, 27</a>.

If it there expressed the state of being in vision, it would denote the same thing here; and consequently the first vision ended with chapter 3, and a new one is here introduced. Nor is it any objection to this view that John, previous to this, as is learned from the first verse of this chapter, was in such a spiritual state as to be able to look up and see a door opened in heaven, and to hear a voice, like the mighty sound of a trumpet, calling him up to a nearer prospect of heavenly things. It is evident that there may be such states of ecstasy independent of vision, just as Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, could look up and see the heavens opened, and the Son of man on the right hand of God. To be in the Spirit denotes a still higher state of spiritual elevation. On what day this vision was given, we are not informed.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 385.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 385.2</span></p>

From this we conclude that they were once participants in the Christian warfare, once trod, in common with all saints, this earthly pilgrimage, but have overcome; and for some good purpose, in advance of the great multitude of the redeemed, are wearing their victor crowns in the heavenly world. Indeed, they plainly tell us as much as this in the song of praise which they, in connection with the four living beings, ascribe to the Lamb, in the 9th verse of the following chapter: “And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.” This song is sung before any of the events in the prophecy of the seven seals transpire; for it is sung to set forth the worthiness of the Lamb to take the book and to open the seals, on the ground of what he had already accomplished, which was their redemption. It is not, therefore, thrown in here by anticipation, having its application in the future; but it expresses an absolute and finished fact in the history of those who sung it. These, then, were a class of redeemed persons, — redeemed from this earth, redeemed as all others must be redeemed, by the precious blood of Christ.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 386.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 386.1</span></p>

Going back to the events that occurred in connection with the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, we read, “And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.49361#49361" data-link="1965.49361">Matthew 27:52, 53</a>. Thus the answer to our question comes back, gathered unmistakably from the sacred page. These are some of those who came out of their graves at the resurrection of Christ, and who were numbered with the illustrious multitude which he led up from the captivity of Death’s dark domain when he ascended in triumph on high. Matthew records their resurrection, Paul their ascension, and John beholds them in heaven, performing the sacred duties which they were raised up to accomplish.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 386.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 386.2</span></p>

Our translation, it is true, reads “seats;” but the Greek is θρόνοι, “thrones;” and so the Revised Version reads: “And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones, and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting.” This passage, consequently, throws light on the expression found in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44771#44771" data-link="1965.44771">Daniel 7:9</a>, “I beheld till the thrones were cast down.” These are the same thrones; and, as has been shown in comments upon that passage, the meaning is not that the thrones were overturned, or cast down, in the ordinary sense of that expression, but placed, or established; and the figure is taken from the Eastern custom of casting down, or placing, mats or divans for distinguished guests to sit upon. These four and twenty elders (see on chapter 5) are supposed to be assistants of Christ in his mediatorial work in the sanctuary on high; and when the judgment scene described in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44771#44771" data-link="1965.44771">Daniel 7:9</a> commenced in the most holy place, their seats, or thrones, would be set, or placed, there, according to the testimony of that passage.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 387.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 387.2</span></p>

The propriety of this correction is now, I believe, generally agreed upon by commentators. The word is very different from θηρίον, used to designate the prophetic beasts in the 13th and following chapters. (Scholefield.)

These living beings are even more intimately connected with the throne than are the four and twenty elders, being represented as in the midst of it, and round about it.

Praise does not become to them monotonous; for with every utterance they gain a new view of the attributes of the Almighty; they reach a greater hight of comprehension in their vision of his perfections; the horizon expands before them; their hearts enlarge; and the new emotions of adoration, from their new standpoint, draw from them a fresh utterance of their holy salutation, new even to themselves, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 389.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 389.3</span></p>

The same view is still before the mind of the apostle. By the words, “him that sat on the throne,” is evidently meant the Father, as the Son is subsequently introduced as “a Lamb as it had been slain.” The book which John here saw, contained a revelation of scenes that were to transpire in the history of the church to the end of time. Its being held in the right hand of him that sat on the throne may signify that a knowledge of the future rests with God alone, except so far as he sees fit to reveal it to others.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 391.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 391.2</span></p>

It was afterward found to contain seven parchments, or small volumes, each of which was separately sealed; but if all the seals had been on the outside, nothing could have been read till they had all been loosed; whereas the loosing of each seal was followed by some discovery of the contents of the roll. Yet the appearance on the outside seems to have indicated that it consisted of seven, or at least of several parts.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 392.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 392.1</span></p>

Who can be found worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? A pause ensues. In silence the universe owns its inability and unworthiness to enter into the counsels of the Creator. “And no man in heaven,” οὐδείς, not merely no man, but no one, no being, in heaven. Is not here proof that the faculties of angels are limited, like those of man, in respect to penetrating the future, and disclosing what is to come? And when the apostle saw that no one came forward to open the book, he greatly feared that the counsels of God which it contained in reference to his people, would never be disclosed, and in natural tenderness of his feelings, and his concern for the church, he wept much. “How far are they,” says Wesley, “from the temper of St. John, who inquire after anything rather than the contents of this book!”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 392.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 392.4</span></p>

This weeping of the apostle sprang from greatness of mind. The tenderness of heart which he always had, appeared more clearly now he was out of his own power. The Revelation was not written without tears, neither without tears will it be understood.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 393.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 393.1</span></p>

God is not willing that any knowledge which can benefit his people, shall be withheld. Provision is made for the opening of the book. Hence one of the elders says to him, “Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.” Why one of the elders should impart this information to John in preference to some other being, does not appear, unless it is that having been redeemed, they would be especially interested in all that pertained to the welfare of the church on earth. Christ is here called the “Lion of the tribe of Juda.” Why called a lion? and why of the tribe of Judah? — As to the first, it is probably to denote his strength. As the lion is the king of beasts, the monarch of the forest, he thus becomes a fit emblem of kingly authority and power. “Of the tribe of Juda.” Doubtless he receives this appellation from the prophecy in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.3017#3017" data-link="1965.3017">Genesis 49:9, 10</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 393.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 393.3</span></p>

That David’s position was specially ordained of Christ, and that he was specially sustained by him, there can be no doubt. David was the type, Christ the antitype. David’s throne and reign over Israel was a type of Christ’s reign over his people. He shall reign upon the throne of his father David. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.50869#50869" data-link="1965.50869">Luke 1:32, 33</a>.

The very next scene introduces us to the great work of Christ as the Redeemer of the world, and the shedding of his blood for the remission of sin and the salvation of man. In this work he was subjected to the fiercest assaults of Satan. But he endured his temptations, bore the agonies of the cross, rose a victor over death and the grave, made the way of redemption sure — triumphed! Hence the four living beings and the four and twenty elders sing, “Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 394.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 394.2</span></p>

Around these there stood those saints who had been redeemed: first, those represented by the four living creatures, then the elders forming the second circle, and the angels (verse 11) forming a third circle.

This is very remarkable. So important is the sacrificial offering of Christ in the sight of God, that he is still represented as being in the very act of pouring out his blood for the offenses of man. This gives great advantage to faith; when any soul comes to the throne of grace, he finds a sacrifice there provided for him to offer to God.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 395.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 395.2</span></p>

But is it not a well-established principle that any action may be attributed to a symbol which could be appropriately performed by the person or being represented by the symbol? And is not this all the explanation that the passage needs? The lamb, we know, is a symbol of Christ. We know there is nothing incongruous in Christ’s taking a book; and when we read that the book was taken, we think of the action, not as performed by the lamb, but by the one of whom the lamb is a symbol.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 395.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 395.4</span></p>

We reply that, though the Revelation deals largely in <em>figures</em>, it does not deal in <em>fictions</em>. There is reality in all the things described; and we gain an understanding of the reality when we get a correct interpretation of the figures. Thus, in this vision we know that the One upon the throne is God. He is really there. We know the Lamb symbolizes Christ. He too is really there. He ascended with a literal, tangible body; and who can say that he does not still retain it? If, then, our great High Priest is a literal being, he must have a literal place in which to minister.

Into that temple John was introduced, at the opening of chapter 4, by the door which was opened in heaven. Into the same temple, be it remembered, he is still looking in verses 11 and 12. And now he beholds the heavenly hosts. (1) Round about the throne are those represented by the four living creatures. (2) Next come the four and twenty elders. (3) Then John views, surrounding the whole, a multitude of the heavenly angels. How many? How many would we suppose could convene within the heavenly temple? “Ten thousand times ten thousand!” exclaims the seer. In this expression alone we have one hundred million! And then, as if no numerical expression was adequate to embrace the countless throng, he further adds, “And thousands of thousands!” Well might Paul call this, in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61674#61674" data-link="1965.61674">Hebrews 12:22</a>, “an innumerable company of angels.” And these were in the sanctuary above. Such was the company that John saw assembled at the place where the worship of a universe centers, and where the wondrous plan of human redemption is going forward to completion. And the central object in this innumerable and holy throng was the Lamb of God; and the central act of his life, which claimed their admiration, was the shedding of his blood for the salvation of fallen man; for every voice in all that heavenly host joined in the ascription which was raised, “Worthy is the Lamb that was <em>slain</em> to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.” Fitting assemblage for such a place! Fitting song of adoration to be raised to Him who by the shedding of his blood became a ransom for many, and who, as our great High Priest, still pleads its merits in the sanctuary above in our behalf. And here, before such an august assemblage, must our characters soon come up in final review. What shall fit us for the searching ordeal? What shall enable us to rise and stand at last with the sinless throng above? O, infinite merit of the blood of Christ! which can cleanse us from all our pollutions, and make us meet to tread the holy hill of Zion! O, infinite grace of God! which can prepare us to endure the glory, and give us boldness to enter into his presence, even with exceeding joy!</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 398.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 398.2</span></p>

In verse 10 the four living creatures and four and twenty elders had declared, “We shall reign on the earth.” Now the prophet’s mind is carried forward to that time. The greatest act of Christ’s intervention for man — the shedding of his blood — having been introduced, nothing could be more natural than that the vision should, for a moment, look over to the time when the grand result of the work then inaugurated should be accomplished, the number of the redeemed be made up, the universe be freed from sin and sinners, and a universal song of adoration go up to God and the Lamb.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 399.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 399.2</span></p>

Commentators, with great unanimity, have seized upon this as proof that Christ must be coeval with the Father; for otherwise, say they, here would be worship paid to the creature which belongs only to the Creator. But this does not seem to be a necessary conclusion. The Scriptures certainly clearly intimate that the existence of Christ had a beginning (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.53134#53134" data-link="1965.53134">John 1:1</a>), which was not so in the case of the Father. (See remarks on <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62759#62759" data-link="1965.62759">Revelation 3:14</a>, where it is shown that Christ is not a created being.) But while he does not possess a co-eternity of past existence with the Father, the beginning of his existence, as the begotten of the Father, antedates the entire work of creation, in relation to which he stands a joint creator with God. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.53138#53138" data-link="1965.53138">John 1:3</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61125#61125" data-link="1965.61125">Hebrews 1:2</a>. Could not the Father ordain that to such a being worship should be rendered equally with himself, without its being idolatry on the part of the worshiper? He has raised him to positions which make it proper that he should be worshiped, and has even commanded that worship should be rendered him, which would not have been necessary had he been equal with the Father in eternity of existence. Christ himself declares that “as the Father hath life in himself, so hath <em>he given</em> to the Son to have life in himself.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.53520#53520" data-link="1965.53520">John 5:26</a>.

The number seven has already been noticed as denoting in the Scriptures completeness and perfection. The seven seals therefore embrace the whole of a certain class of events, reaching down to the close of probationary time. Hence to say, as some do, that the seals denote a series of events reaching down perhaps to the time of Constantine, and the seven trumpets another series from that time farther on, cannot be correct. The trumpets denote a series of events which transpire contemporaneously with the events of the seals, but of an entirely different character. A trumpet is a symbol of war; hence the trumpets denote great political commotions to take place among the nations during the gospel age. The seals denote events of a religious character, and contain the history of the church from the opening of the Christian era to the coming of Christ.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 402.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 402.2</span></p>

Was it merely a written description of the events which was read to him as each successive seal was opened? or was it a pictorial illustration of the events which the book contained, and which was presented before him as the seals were broken? or was it a scenic representation which passed before him, the different actors coming forth and performing their parts? Barnes decides in favor of calling them pictorial illustrations; for he thinks a merely written description would not answer to the language of the apostle setting forth what he saw, and a mere scenic representation could have no connection with the opening of the seals. But to the view held by Dr. Barnes there are two serious objections: (1) The book was said to contain only <em>writing</em> within, not pictorial illustrations; and (2) John saw the characters which made up the various scenes, not fixed and motionless upon canvas, but living and moving, and engaging actively in the parts assigned them. The view which to us seems most consistent is that the book contained a record of events which were to transpire; and when the seals were broken, and the record was brought to light, the scenes were presented before John, not by the reading of the description, but by a representation of what was described in the book being made to pass before his mind in living characters, in the place where the reality was to transpire; namely, on the earth.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 402.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 402.3</span></p>

The whiteness of the horse denotes the purity of faith in that age; and the crown which was given to the rider, and his going forth conquering and to make still further conquests, the zeal and success with which the truth was promulgated by its earliest ministers. To this it is objected that the ministers of Christ and the progress of the gospel could not be properly represented by such warlike symbols. But we ask, By what symbols could the work of Christianity better be represented when it went forth as an aggressive principle against the huge systems of error with which it had at first to contend? The rider upon this horse went forth — where? His commission was unlimited. The gospel was to all the world.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 403.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 403.1</span></p>

This is doubtless designed to be significant. If the whiteness of the first horse denoted the purity of the gospel in the period which that symbol covers, the redness of the second horse would signify that in this period that original purity began to be corrupted. The mystery of iniquity already worked in Paul’s day; and the professed church of Christ, it would seem, was now so far corrupted by it as to require this change in the color of the symbol. Errors began to arise. Worldliness came in. The ecclesiastical power sought the alliance of the secular. Troubles and commotions were the result. The spirit of this period perhaps reached its climax as we come down to the days of Constantine, the first so-called Christian emperor, whose conversion to Christianity is dated by Mosheim in A.

Constantine aided the clergy, and put them under obligations to him. He legislated for the church, called the Council of Nicaea, and was most prominent in that Council. Constantine, not the gospel, had the glory of tearing down the heathen temples. The state had the glory instead of the church. Constantine made decrees against some errors, and was praised, and suffered to go on and introduce many other errors, and oppose some important truths. Controversies arose; and when a new emperor took the throne, there was a rush of the clergy to get him on the side of their peculiar tenets. Mosheim says of this period, ‘There was continual war and trouble.’”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 404.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 404.3</span></p>

The time that intervened between the reign of Constantine and the establishment of the papacy in A.

Of a period immediately succeeding the days of Constantine, Mosheim says: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 405.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 405.2</span></p>

Hence arose that extravagant veneration for departed saints, and those absurd notions of a certain fire destined to purify separate souls, that now prevailed, and of which the public marks were everywhere to be seen. Hence also the celibacy of priests, the worship of images and relics, which in process of time almost utterly destroyed the Christian religion, or at least eclipsed its luster, and corrupted its very essence in the most deplorable manner. An enormous train of superstitions was gradually substituted for true religion and genuine piety. This odious revolution proceeded from a variety of causes. A ridiculous precipitation in receiving new opinions, a preposterous desire of imitating the pagan rites, and of blending them with the Christian worship, and that idle propensity which the generality of mankind have toward a gaudy and ostentatious religion, all contributed to establish the reign of superstition upon the ruins of Christianity. Accordingly, frequent pilgrimages were undertaken to Palestine, and to the tombs of the martyrs, as if there alone the sacred principles of virtue and the certain hope of salvation were to be acquired. The reins being once let loose to superstition, which knows no bounds, absurd notions and idle ceremonies multiplied almost every day. Quantities of dust and earth brought from Palestine, and other places remarkable for their supposed sanctity, were handed about as the most powerful remedies against the violence of wicked spirits, and were sold and bought everywhere at enormous prices. The public processions and supplications by which the pagans endeavored to appease their gods, were now adopted into the Christian worship, and celebrated in many places with great pomp and magnificence. The virtues which had formerly been ascribed to the heathen temples, to their lustrations, to the statues of their gods and heroes, were now attributed to Christian churches, to water consecrated by certain forms of prayer, and to the images of holy men. And the same privileges that the former enjoyed under the darkness of paganism, were conferred upon the latter under the light of the gospel, or, rather, under that cloud of superstition which was obscuring its glory. It is true that, as yet, images were not very common, nor were there any statues at all. But it is at the same time as undoubtedly certain as it is extravagant and monstrous, that the worship of the martyrs was modeled, by degrees, according to the religious services that were paid to the gods before the coming of Christ.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 405.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 405.3</span></p>

On this point, Dr. A. Clarke says: “A symbolical vision was exhibited, in which he saw an altar. And under it the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God — martyred for their attachment to Christianity — are represented as being newly slain as victims to idolatry and superstition. <em>The altar is upon earth</em>, <em>not in heaven</em>.” A confirmation of this view is found in the fact that John is beholding scenes upon the earth. The souls are represented under the altar, just as victims slain upon it would pour out their blood beneath it, and fall by its side.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 409.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 409.4</span></p>

Here, it is claimed, are souls seen by John in a disembodied state; and they were conscious, and had knowledge of passing events; for they cried for vengeance on their persecutors. This view of the passage is inadmissible, for several reasons: (1) The popular view places these souls in heaven; but the altar of sacrifice on which they were slain, and beneath which they were seen, cannot be there. The only altar we read of in heaven is the altar of incense; but it would not be correct to represent victims just slain as under the altar of incense, as that altar was never devoted to such a use. (2) It would be repugnant to all our ideas of the heavenly state, to represent souls in heaven <em>shut up</em> under an altar. (3) Can we suppose that the idea of <em>vengeance</em> would reign so supreme in the minds of souls in heaven as to render them, despite the joy and glory of that ineffable state, dissatisfied and uneasy till vengeance was inflicted upon their enemies? Would they not rather rejoice that persecution raised its hand against them, and thus hastened them into the presence of their Redeemer, at whose right hand there is fulness of joy, and pleasures forevermore? But, further, the popular view which puts these souls in heaven, puts the wicked at the same time in the lake of fire, writhing in unutterable torment, and in <em>full view</em> of the heavenly host. This, it is claimed, is proved by the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, as recorded in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.52276#52276" data-link="1965.52276">Luke 16</a>. Now the souls brought to view under the fifth seal were those who had been slain under the preceding seal, scores of years, and most of them centuries, before. Beyond any question, their persecutors had all passed off the stage of action, and, according to the view under consideration, were suffering all the torments of hell right before their eyes. Yet, as if not satisfied with this, they cry to God as though he were delaying vengeance on their murderers. What greater vengeance could they want? Or, if their persecutors were still on the earth, they must know that they would, in a few years at most, join the vast multitude daily pouring through the gate of death into the world of woe. Their amiability is put in no better light even by this supposition. One thing, at least, is evident: The popular theory concerning the condition of the dead, righteous and wicked, cannot be correct, or the interpretation usually given to this passage is not correct; for they devour each other.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 410.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 410.1</span></p>

This argument would be of weight, were there no such figure of speech as personification. But while there is, it will be proper, on certain conditions, to attribute life, action, and intelligence to inanimate objects. Thus the blood of Abel is said to have cried to God from the ground. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.184#184" data-link="1965.184">Genesis 4:9, 10</a>.

From that definition, he is led to suppose that this text speaks of an immaterial, invisible, immortal essence in man, which soars into its coveted freedom on the death of its hindrance and clog, the mortal body. No instance of the occurrence of the word in the original Hebrew or Greek will sustain such a definition. It oftenest means <em>life</em>, and is not unfrequently rendered <em>person</em>. It applies to the dead as well as to the living, as may be seen by reference to <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.80#80" data-link="1965.80">Genesis 2:7</a>, where the word living need not have been expressed were life an inseparable attribute of the soul; and to <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.8747#8747" data-link="1965.8747">Numbers 19:13</a>, where the Hebrew Concordance reads, “dead soul.” Moreover, these souls pray that their <em>blood</em> may be avenged, — an article which the immaterial soul, as popularly understood, is not supposed to possess. The word <em>souls</em> may be regarded as here meaning simply the martyrs, those who had been slain, the words, <em>souls of them</em>, being a periphrasis for the whole person. They were represented to John as having been slain upon the altar of papal sacrifice, on this earth, and lying dead beneath it. They certainly were not alive when John saw them under the fifth seal; for he again brings to view the same company, in almost the same language, and assures us that the first time they live after their martyrdom, is at the resurrection of the just. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63340#63340" data-link="1965.63340">Revelation 20:4-6</a>.

Then it was seen that they had suffered, not for being vile and criminal, but “for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.” Then their praises were sung, their virtues admired, their fortitude applauded, their names honored, and their memories cherished.

The full vindication of their cause was to be delayed a little season. And during this time, Rome added hundreds of thousands to the vast throng of whose blood she had already become guilty.

Its effects were even extended to the waters in many places, where the shocks were not perceptible. It pervaded the greater portion of Europe, Africa, and America; but its extreme violence was exercised on the southwestern part of the former. In Africa, this earthquake was felt almost as severely as it had been in Europe. A great part of Algiers was destroyed. Many houses were thrown down at Fez and Mequinez, and multitudes were buried beneath the ruins. Similar effects were realized at Morocco. Its effects were likewise felt at Tangier, at Tetuan, at Funchal in the Island of Madeira. It is probable that all Africa was shaken. At the north, it extended to Norway and Sweden. Germany, Holland, France, Great Britain, and Ireland were all more or less agitated by the same great commotion of the elements. Lisbon (Portugal), previous to the earthquake in 1755, contained 150,000 inhabitants. Mr. Barretti says that 90,000 persons “were lost on that fatal day.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 414.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 414.4</span></p>

Nobody wept; it was beyond tears. They ran hither and thither, delirious with horror and astonishment, beating their faces and breasts, crying, ‘<em>Misericordia</em>; the <em>world’s</em> <em>at an end!</em>’ Mothers forgot their children, and ran about loaded with crucifixed images. Unfortunately, many ran to the churches for protection; but in vain was the sacrament exposed; in vain did the poor creatures embrace the altars; images, priests, and people were buried in one common ruin.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 415.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 415.1</span></p>

The shock was instantly followed by the fall of every church and convent, almost all the large and public buildings, and more than one fourth of the houses. In about two hours after the shock, fires broke out in different quarters, and raged with such violence for the space of nearly three days that the city was completely desolated. The earthquake happened on a holy day, when the churches and convents were full of people, very few of whom escaped.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 415.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 415.2</span></p>

A sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet above its ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan, and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked; but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 416.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 416.2</span></p>

A great concourse of people had collected there for safety, as a spot where they might be beyond the reach of falling ruins; but suddenly the quay sunk down with all the people on it, and not one of the dead bodies ever floated to the surface. A great number of boats and small vessels anchored near it, all full of people, were swallowed up as in a whirlpool. No fragments of these wrecks ever rose again to the surface, and the water in the place where the quay had stood is stated, in many accounts, to be unfathomable; but Whitehurst says he ascertained it to be one hundred fathoms.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 416.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 416.3</span></p>

Yet in adopting this latter hypothesis, we must suppose that the upper part of the chasm, to the depth of one hundred fathoms, remained open after the shock. According to the observations made at Lisbon in 1837 by Mr. Sharpe, the destroying effects of this earthquake were confined to the tertiary strata, and were most violent on the blue clay, on which the lower part of the city is constructed. Not a building, he says, on the secondary limestone or the basalt was injured.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 416.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 416.4</span></p>

The movement was most violent in Spain, Portugal, and the north of Africa; but nearly the whole of Europe, and even the West Indies, felt the shock on the same day. A seaport called St. Ubes, about twenty miles south of Lisbon, was engulfed. At Algiers and Fez in Africa, the agitation of the earth was equally violent, and at the distance of eight leagues from Morocco, a village, with the inhabitants, to the number of about eight or ten thousand persons, together with all their cattle, were swallowed up. Soon after, the earth closed again over them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 417.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 417.1</span></p>

Off St. Lucas, the captain of the ship ‘Nancy’ felt his vessel so violently shaken that he thought she had struck the ground, but, on heaving the lead, found a great depth of water. Captain Clark, from Denia, in latitude 36° 24’ N., between nine and ten in the morning, had his ship shaken and strained as if she had struck upon a rock. Another ship, forty leagues west of St. Vincent, experienced so violent a concussion that the men were thrown a foot and a half perpendicularly up from the deck. In Antigua and Barbadoes, as also in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Corsica, Switzerland, and Italy, tremors and slight oscillations of the ground were felt.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 417.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 417.2</span></p>

At Loch Lomond, in Scotland, for example, the water, without the least apparent cause, rose against its banks, and then subsided below its usual level. The greatest perpendicular hight of this swell was two feet four inches, It is said that the movement of this earthquake was undulatory, and that it traveled at the rate of twenty miles a minute. A great wave swept over the coast of Spain, and is said to have been sixty feet high at Cadiz. At Tangier, in Africa, it rose and fell eighteen times on the coast; at Funchal, in Madeira, it rose full fifteen feet perpendicular above high-water mark, although the tide, which ebbs and flows there seven feet, was then at half ebb. Besides entering the city and committing great havoc, it overflowed other seaports in the island. At Kinsale, in Ireland, a body of water rushed into the harbor, whirled round several vessels, and poured into the marketplace.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 417.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 417.3</span></p>

In order to account for the phenomenon, Mitchell imagines a subsidence at the bottom of the sea from the giving way of the roof of some cavity, in consequence of a vacuum produced by the condensation of steam. Such condensation, he observes, might be the first effect of the introduction of a large body of water into fissures and cavities already filled with steam, before there had been sufficient time for the heat of the incandescent lava to turn so large a supply of water into steam, which, being soon accomplished, causes a greater explosion.” <em>— Library of Choice Literature</em>,<em> Vol. VII</em>,<em> pp</em>,<em> 162</em>,<em> 163</em>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 418.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 418.1</span></p>

The air all this time was of a dingy yellowish color. At half past one o’clock it was so dark as to necessitate the lighting of candles, in order to attend to domestic duties. At about three in the afternoon the darkness became more dense, increasing in intensity until half past three, when the wind breezed up from the southwest, and brought on a slight fall of rain, accompanied with a profuse quantity of fine, black particles, in appearance much like sulphur, both in smell and quality. A sheet of clean paper held out in the rain was rendered quite black wherever the drops fell upon it; but when held near the fire, it turned to a yellow color, and, when burned, it fizzed on the paper like wet powder. So black did these powdery particles turn everything upon which they fell, that even the river was covered with a black froth, which, when skimmed off the surface, resembled the lather of soap, with this difference, that it was more greasy, and its color as black as ink. At seven in the evening the air was more clear. This phenomenon was observed throughout a <em>vast region of country</em>; and though various conjectures were indulged in as to the cause of so extraordinary an occurrence, the same degree of mystery attaches to it as to that of 1780, confounding the wisdom even of the most learned philosophers and men of science.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 421.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 421.5</span></p>

I called to my wife to behold; and while robing, she exclaimed, ‘See how the stars fall!’ I replied, ‘That is the wonder;’ and we felt in our hearts that it was a sign of the last days. For truly ‘the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.’ <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62854#62854" data-link="1965.62854">Revelation 6:13</a>. This language of the prophet has always been received as metaphorical. Yesterday it was literally fulfilled. The ancients understood by <em>aster</em> in Greek, and <em>stella</em> in Latin, the smaller lights of heaven. The refinement of modern astronomy has made distinction between stars of heaven and meteors of heaven. Therefore the idea of the prophet, as it is expressed in the original Greek, was literally fulfilled in the phenomenon of yesterday, so as no man before yesterday had conceived to be possible that it should be fulfilled. The immense size and distance of the planets and fixed stars forbid the idea of their falling <em>unto the earth</em>. Larger bodies cannot fail in myriads unto a smaller body; and most of the planets and all the fixed stars are many times larger than our earth; but these fell toward the earth. And how did they fall? Neither myself nor one of the family heard any report; and were I to hunt through nature for a simile, I could not find one so apt, to illustrate the appearance of the heavens, as that which St. John uses in the prophecy before quoted: ‘The stars of heaven fell unto the earth.’ They were not sheets, or flakes, or drops of fire; but they were what the world understands by falling stars; and one speaking to his fellow, in the midst of the scene, would say, ‘See how the stars fall!’ And he who heard would not stop to correct the astronomy of the speaker, any more than he would reply, ‘The sun does not move,’ to one who should tell him, ‘The sun is rising.’ The stars fell ‘even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.’ Here is the exactness of the prophet. The falling stars did not come as if from several trees shaken, but from <em>one</em>. Those which appeared in the east fell toward the east; those which appeared in the north fell toward the north; those which appeared in the west fell toward the west; and those which appeared in the south (for I went out of my residence into the park), fell toward the south. And they fell not as <em>ripe</em> fruit falls; far from it; but they flew, they were <em>cast</em>, like the unripe, which at first refuses to leave the branch, and when, under a violent pressure, it does break its hold, it flies swiftly, straight off, descending; and in the multitude falling, some cross the track of others, as they are thrown with more or less force, but each one falls on its own side of the tree.” — <em>Henry Dana Ward</em>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 422.8 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 422.8</span></p>

The darkness, said Dr. Samuel Tenney, of Exeter, N. H., was produced by common clouds. Between these common clouds and the earth intervened another stratum of great thickness. As the stratum advanced, the darkness commenced, and increased with its progress. The uncommon thickness of this stratum was occasioned by two strong currents of wind from the southward and westward, condensing the vapors and drawing them in a northwest direction. The density of this stratum was owing to the vapor and smoke it contained. These so-called dark days have not been uncommon, being known in 366 B. C., 295 B. C., 252 A.

This caviler’s explanation amounts to just this: It was dark because there was great darkness. He simply states the fact in another form, and calls that an explanation. His own statement needs explaining as really as the one to which he refers. “The uncommon thickness of the stratum was caused by two strong currents of wind,” etc. How did those winds chance to come just then, and just when there were vapors to condense? And what caused the vapors? Then how could currents from the west and south draw the vapors “in a <em>northwest</em> direction”? Common philosophy would assign them, under such circumstances, a <em>northeasterly</em> direction.

Now it matters not if our opponents should claim seven thousand dark days instead of seven, each as notable as the one of 1780, it would not affect the prediction or the sign in the least degree.

Thus: “And” the stars of heaven shall fall, “and” the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken, “and” then shall they see the Son of man coming, “and” then shall he send his angels to gather the elect. Now the language certainly is not designed to convey the idea that all these things were to take place within those days; for in that case we should have the coming of Christ itself take place before the days ended. Verse 29, stating the conclusion of the argument, says, “So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.” Matthew puts it in still stronger language when he says, “So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it [margin, he, Christ] is near, even at the doors.” But it would be absurd to say that we must wait till the coming of Christ takes place before we can know that that event is near, even at the doors.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 430.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 430.3</span></p>

The beginning of the series is placed at a point before the close of a certain prophetic period designated as “those days,” that is, the 1260 years of papal oppression upon the church; but the end of the series lies far outside of that period, as already shown. Now, the question to be decided is, How many events of the series given us are to be looked for before the date by which “those days” are limited, that is, before 1798, where the 1260 days, or years, terminated? The only data we have on which to frame an answer are the facts already noticed; namely, that the events begin within that period, but close outside of it, and no specified number is given as belonging to that period.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 431.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 431.1</span></p>

Had the sun alone been darkened before 1798, it would have been sufficient to fulfill the prophecy. The moon even might have been darkened this side of 1798 without vitiating the prophecy in the least degree. The sun and moon were darkened together in 1780, eighteen years before the days ended; the stars fell in 1833, thirty-five years after the end of the days. We have reached the year 1897, ninety-nine years this side the ending of the days, and the shaking of the powers of heaven will be completed not far hence, as other prophecies show; and in immediate connection with that, as Joel and John plainly declare, the coming of the Lord is to take place.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 431.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 431.2</span></p>

Then will the earth “reel to and fro like a drunkard;” it will be “dissolved” and “utterly broken down” (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.36921#36921" data-link="1965.36921">Isaiah 24</a>); mountains will move from their firm bases; islands will suddenly change their location in the midst of the sea; from the level plain will arise the precipitous mountain; rocks will thrust up their ragged forms from earth’s broken surface; and while the voice of God is reverberating through the earth, the direst confusion will reign over the face of nature.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 432.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 432.3</span></p>

Isaiah (24: 19, 20) says: “The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.” Jeremiah (4: 23-27) in thrilling language describes the scene as follows: “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.... For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate.” (See also the scriptures referred to above.)</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 432.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 432.4</span></p>

Kings, who, intoxicated with their own earthly authority, have never dreamed of a higher power than themselves, now realize that there is One who reigns King of kings; and the great men behold the vanity of all earthly pomp, for there is a greatness above that of earth; and the rich men throw their silver and gold to the moles and bats, for it cannot save them in that day; and the chief captains forget their little brief authority, and the mighty men their might; and every bondman who is in the still worse bondage of sin, and every freeman, — all classes of the wicked, from the highest to the lowest, — join in the general wail of consternation and despair. They who never prayed to Him whose arm could bring salvation, now raise an agonizing prayer to rocks and mountains to bury them forever from the sight of Him whose presence brings to them destruction. Fain would they now avoid reaping what they have sown by a life of lust and sin. Fain would they now shun the fearful treasure of wrath which they have been heaping up for themselves against this day. Fain would they bury themselves and their catalogue of crimes in everlasting darkness. And so they fly to the rocks, caves, caverns, and fissures, which the broken surface of the earth now presents before them. But it is too late. They cannot conceal their guilt, nor escape the long-delayed vengeance. “It will be in vain to call, Rocks and mountains on us fall; For His hand will find out all, In that day.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 433.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 433.1</span></p>

The sixth chapter closed with the events of the sixth seal, and the seventh seal is not mentioned until we reach the opening of chapter 8. The whole of chapter 7 is therefore thrown in here parenthetically. Why is it thus thrown in at this point? — Evidently for the purpose of stating additional particulars concerning the sixth seal. The expression, “after these things,” does not mean after the fulfillment of all the events previously described; but after the prophet had been carried down in vision to the close of the sixth seal, in order not to break the consecutive order of events as given in chapter 6, his mind is called to what is mentioned in chapter 7, as further particulars to transpire in connection with that seal. Then we inquire, Between what events in that seal does this work come in? It must transpire before the departing of the heavens as a scroll; for after that event there is no place for such a work as this. And it must take place subsequently to the signs in the sun, moon, and stars; for these signs have been fulfilled, and such a work has not yet been accomplished. It comes in, therefore, between the <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62854#62854" data-link="1965.62854">13th</a> and <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62856#62856" data-link="1965.62856">14th</a> verses of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62830#62830" data-link="1965.62830">Revelation 6</a>; but there, as already shown, is just where we now stand. Hence the first part of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62865#62865" data-link="1965.62865">Revelation 7</a> relates to a work the accomplishment of which may be looked for at the present time.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 435.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 435.2</span></p>

For it will be noticed (verse 3) that the “hurting” is a work committed to their hands equally with the “holding;” so that they do not merely let the winds go when they are to blow, but they <em>cause</em> them to blow; they <em>impel</em> forward the work of destruction with their own supernatural energy. But the hurting process here brought to view does not include the seven last plagues. That work is given into the hands of seven special angels; this, into the hands of four. Or, it may be that when the time comes for the pouring out of the plagues, the seven angels who have specific charge of these judgments, unite with the four whose mission it is to cause the winds to blow, and all together bring on that pre-eminent exhibition of divine vengeance against a generation which is pre-eminent in guilt.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 436.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 436.1</span></p>

The seal of God, as brought to view in our text, is to be applied to the servants of God. We are not, of course, to suppose that in this case it is some literal mark to be made in the flesh, but that it is some institution or observance having special reference to God, which will serve as a “mark of distinction” between the worshipers of God and those who are not in truth his servants, though they may profess to follow him.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 437.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 437.3</span></p>

We have, then, but to examine these commandments to see which one it is that constitutes the seal of the law, or, in other words, makes known the true God, the law-making power. The first three commandments mention the word <em>God</em>; but we cannot tell from these who is meant, for there are multitudes of objects to which this name is applied. There are “gods many and lords many,” as the apostle says. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.58183#58183" data-link="1965.58183">1 Corinthians 8:5</a>. Passing over the fourth commandment for the time being, the fifth contains the words <em>Lord</em> and <em>God</em>, but does not define them; and the remaining five precepts do not contain the name of God at all. Now what shall be done? With that portion of the law which we have examined, it would be impossible to convict the grossest idolater of sin. The worshiper of images could say, This idol before me is my god; his name is god, and these are his precepts. The worshiper of the heavenly bodies could also say, The sun is my god, and I worship him according to this law. Thus, without the fourth commandment, the decalogue is null and void, so far as it pertains to enforcing the worship of the true God. But let us now add the fourth commandment, restore to the law this precept, which many are ready to contend has been expunged, and see how the case will then stand, As we examine this commandment, which contains the declaration, “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,” etc., we see at once that we are reading the requirements of Him who created all things. The sun, then, is not the God of the decalogue; the true God is he who made the sun. No object in heaven or earth is the being who here demands obedience; for the God of this law is the one who made all created things. Now we have a weapon against idolatry. Now this law can no longer be applied to false gods, who “have not made the heavens and the earth.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.39206#39206" data-link="1965.39206">Jeremiah 10:11</a>. Now the author of this law has declared who he is, the extent of his dominion, and his right to rule; for every created intelligence must at once assent that He who is the Creator of all, has a right to demand obedience from all his creatures. Thus with the fourth commandment in its place, this wonderful document, the decalogue, the only document among men which God ever wrote with his own finger, has a signature; it has that which renders it intelligible and authentic; it has a seal. But without the fourth commandment, it lacks all these things.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 439.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 439.5</span></p>

Abraham was chosen at first, because he was the friend of God, while his fathers were idolaters; and his seed were chosen to be God’s people, the guardians of his law and the depositaries of his truth, because all others had apostatized from him; and it is true that these words respecting the Sabbath were spoken to them while they enjoyed the honor of being thus set apart from all others. But when the middle wall of partition was broken down, and the Gentiles were called in to be partakers of the blessings of Abraham, all God’s people, both Jews and Gentiles, were brought into a new and more intimate relation to God through his Son, and they are now called “Jews inwardly,” and “Israelites indeed.” And now the declaration applies to all such; for they have as much occasion to <em>know</em> the Lord as had his people of old.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 441.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 441.1</span></p>

By the scenes introduced in the verses before us, namely, the four winds apparently about to blow, bringing war and trouble upon the land, and this work restrained till the servants of God should be sealed, as though a preparatory work must be done for them to save them from this trouble, we are reminded of the houses of the Israelites marked with the blood of the paschal lamb, and spared as the destroying angel passed over to slay the first-born of the Egyptians (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.3701#3701" data-link="1965.3701">Exodus 12</a>); also of the mark made by the man with a writer’s ink-horn (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.42086#42086" data-link="1965.42086">Ezekiel 9</a>) upon all those who were to be spared by the men with the slaughtering weapons who followed after; and we conclude that the seal of God, here placed upon his servants, is some distinguishing mark, or religious characteristic, through which they will be exempted from the judgments of God that fall on the wicked around them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 442.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 442.1</span></p>

It is one of the most singular facts to be met with in religious history that, in an age of such boasted gospel light as the present, when the influence of Christianity is so powerful and wide-spread, one of the most striking peculiarities in practice which a person can adopt, and one of the greatest crosses he can take up, even in the most enlightened and Christian lands, is the simple observance of the law of God. For the fourth commandment requires the observance of the seventh day of each week as the Sabbath of the Lord; but almost all Christendom, through the combined influences of paganism and the papacy, have been beguiled into the keeping of the first day. A person has but to commence the observance of the day enjoined in the commandment, and a mark of peculiarity is upon him at once.

But, excepting the fourth, there is no commandment of the decalogue upon which the Christian world theoretically needs reforming; and that this is the representative question in this message is evident from the fact that the keeping of the commandments, observing, with all the other moral precepts, the Lord’s Sabbath, is what distinguishes the servants of God from those who worship the beast and receive his mark, which is, as will be hereafter shown, the observance of a counterfeit sabbath.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 443.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 443.3</span></p>

In exact accordance with the foregoing chronological argument, we find this work already in process of fulfillment before our eyes. The third angel’s message is going forth; the angel ascending from the east is on his mission; the reform on the Sabbath question has commenced; it is surely, though yet in comparative silence, working its way through the land; it is destined to agitate every country entitled to the light of the gospel; and it will result in bringing out a people prepared for the soon coming of the Saviour, and sealed for his everlasting kingdom.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 444.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 444.1</span></p>

Have we seen among the nations any movements which would indicate that the cry of the ascending angel, “Hurt not,” etc., by the blowing of the winds, “till we have sealed the servants of our God,” has in any manner been answered? The time during which the winds are held could not, from the nature of the case, be a time of profound peace. This would not answer to the prophecy. For in order to make it manifest that the winds are being held, there must be disturbance, agitation, anger, and jealousy among the nations, with an occasional outburst of strife, like a fitful gust breaking away from the imprisoned and struggling tempest; and these outbursts must be suddenly and unexpectedly checked. Then, but not otherwise, would it be evident to him who looked at events in the light of the prophecy, that for some good purpose the restraining hand of Omnipotence was laid upon the surging elements of strife and war. And such has been the aspect of our times for nearly half a century. Commencing with the great revolution of 1848, when so many European thrones toppled into the dust, what a state of anger and political unrest has existed among all the nations of the earth! New and unlooked-for complications have suddenly sprung up, throwing matters into apparently inextricable confusion, and threatening immediate and direful war. And now and then the conflict has burst forth in fury, and a thousand voices have been raised to predict that the great crisis had come, that universal war must result, and the termination no man could foretell, when suddenly and unaccountably it has been extinguished, and all subsided into quiet again. In our own land the terrible civil war of 1861 to 1865 is a notable instance. By the spring of the latter year, so great had become the pressure upon the nation for men and means to continue the war that it began seriously to impede the progress of the work symbolized by the ascending angel, even threatening to arrest it entirely. Those interested in these truths, believing that the time had come for the application of the prophecy, and that the words of the angel, “Hurt not,” etc., indicated a movement on the part of the church, accordingly raised their petitions to the Ruler of nations to restrain the cruel work of tumult and war. Days of fasting and prayer were set apart for this purpose. The time at which this occurred was a dark and gloomy period of the war; and not a few high in political life predicted its indefinite continuance, and an appalling intensity of all its evils. But suddenly a change came; and not three months had elapsed from the time of which we speak, ere the last army of the Southern Confederacy had surrendered, and all its soldiers had laid down their arms. So sudden and entire was the collapse, and so grateful were all hearts for relief from the pressure of the terrible strife, that the nation broke forth into a song of jubilee, and these words were conspicuously displayed at the national capitol: “<em>This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes</em>.” There are those who believe there was a definite cause for this sudden cessation of the strife, of which, of course, the world is but little aware. The sudden conclusion of the Franco-German war of 1870 and the recent war between Turkey and Russia, may be cited as still later examples. Perhaps further events of this kind are yet to be witnessed to fulfill more completely this feature of the prophecy.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 444.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 444.2</span></p>

They do not see how it can apply to our own time, when every trace of distinction between these tribes has been so long and so completely obliterated. We refer such persons to the opening language of the Epistle of James: “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the <em>twelve tribes</em> which are scattered abroad, greeting. <em>My brethren</em>, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,” etc. Those whom James here addresses are (1) Christians; for they are his brethren; (2) They are not the converts to Christianity from the Jews, the twelve tribes of his own day; for he addresses them in view of the coming of the Lord. (See chapter 5.) He is thus addressing the last generation of Christians, the Christians of our own day; and he calls them the twelve tribes scattered abroad. How can this be? Paul explains in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57557#57557" data-link="1965.57557">Romans 11:17-24</a>. In the striking figure of grafting which he there introduces, the tame olive tree represents Israel. Some of the branches, the natural descendants of Abraham, were broken off because of unbelief (in Christ). Through faith in Christ the wild olive scions, the Gentiles, are grafted into the tame olive stock, and thus the twelve tribes are perpetuated. And here we find an explanation of the language of the same apostle: “They are not all Israel which are of Israel,” and “he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, ... but he is a Jew which is one inwardly.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57425#57425" data-link="1965.57425">Romans 9:6-8</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57076#57076" data-link="1965.57076">2:28, 29</a>. So we find on the gates of the New Jerusalem — which is a New Testament or Christian, not a Jewish, city — the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. On the foundations of this city are inscribed the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63387#63387" data-link="1965.63387">Revelation 21:12-14</a>. If the twelve tribes belong exclusively to the former dispensation, the more natural order would have been to have their names on the foundations, and those of the twelve apostles on the gates; but no, the names of the twelve tribes are on the gates. And as through these gates, so inscribed, all the redeemed hosts will go in and out, so, as belonging to these twelve tribes, will all the redeemed be reckoned, whether on earth they were Jews or Gentiles. Of course we look in vain for any marks of distinction between the tribes here on earth; and since Christ has appeared in the flesh, the preservation of the genealogy of the tribes is not necessary. But in heaven, where the names of the church of the first-born are being enrolled, we may be sure there is order, and that each name is enrolled in its own tribe. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.61676#61676" data-link="1965.61676">Hebrews 12:23</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 446.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 446.2</span></p>

The twelve sons of Jacob, who became the heads of great families, called tribes, were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, and Joseph. But Jacob, on his dying bed, adopted the sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, to constitute two of the tribes of Israel. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.2964#2964" data-link="1965.2964">Genesis 48:5</a>. This divided the tribe of Joseph, making thirteen tribes in all. Yet in the distribution of the land of Canaan by lot, they numbered but twelve tribes, and made but twelve lots; for the tribe of Levi was left out, being appointed to the service of the tabernacle, and having no inheritance. But in the passage before us, Ephraim and Dan are omitted, and Levi and Joseph put in their places. The omission of Dan is accounted for by commentators on the ground that that tribe was the one chiefly addicted to idolatry. (See <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.14227#14227" data-link="1965.14227">Judges 18</a>, etc.) The tribe of Levi here takes its place with the rest, as in the heavenly Canaan * the reasons for their not having an inheritance will not exist, as in the earthly; and Joseph is probably put for Ephraim, it being a name which appears to have been applied to either the tribe of Ephraim or Manasseh. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.8309#8309" data-link="1965.8309">Numbers 13:11</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 447.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 447.1</span></p>

For John did know who they were, and from whence they came; inasmuch as he had just said that they were people — redeemed of course — out of all nations, kindreds, people, and tongues; and John could have answered, These are the redeemed ones from all the nations of the earth. But if a special company in this vast throng were referred to, distinguished by some special mark or position, then it might not be so evident who they were, and what had given them their peculiarity; and the questions, as applied to them, would be appropriate and pertinent. We therefore incline to the view that attention is called to a special company by the questions which were proposed by one of the elders; and no company is brought to view to which special allusion would more naturally be made than to the company spoken of in the first part of the chapter; namely, the 144,000. John had indeed seen this company in their mortal state, as they were receiving the seal of the living God amid the troublous scenes of the last days; but as they here stand among the redeemed throng, the transition is so great, and the condition in which they now appear so different, that he does not recognize them as the special company which he saw sealed upon the earth.

The angel which approaches the altar is not one of the seven trumpet angels. The altar is the altar of incense, which, in the earthly sanctuary, was placed in the first apartment. Here, then, is another proof that there exists in heaven a sanctuary with its corresponding vessels of service, of which the earthly was a figure, and that we are taken into that sanctuary by the visions of John. A work of ministration for all the saints in the sanctuary above is thus brought to view. Doubtless the entire work of mediation for the people of God during the gospel dispensation is here presented. This is apparent from the fact that the angel offers his incense with the prayers of <em>all</em> saints. And that we are here carried forward to the end, is evident from the act of the angel in filling the censer with fire and casting it unto the earth; for his work is then done; no more prayers are to be offered up mingled with incense; and this symbolic act can have its application only at the time when the ministration of Christ in the sanctuary in behalf of mankind has forever ceased. And following the angel’s act are voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake, — exactly such occurrences as we are elsewhere informed transpire at the close of human probation.

Though they should be tossed like feathers upon the tumultuous waves of strife and war, they were to know that their great High Priest still ministered for them in the sanctuary in heaven, and that thither they could direct their prayers, and have them offered, with incense, to their Father in heaven.

To use his words in more direct comment, we read thus the sum of the matter: The Gothic nation was in arms at the first sound of the trumpet, and in the uncommon severity of the winter, they rolled their ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the river. The fertile fields of Phocis and Boeotia were crowded with a deluge of barbarians; the males were massacred; the females and cattle of the flaming villages were driven away. The deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths could easily be discovered after several years. The whole territory of Attica was blasted by the baneful presence of Alaric. The most fortunate of the inhabitants of Corinth, Argos, and Sparta, were saved by death from beholding the conflagration of their cities. In a season of such extreme heat that the beds of the rivers were dry, Alaric invaded the dominion of the West. A secluded ‘old man of Verona,’ the poet Claudian, pathetically lamented the fate of his contemporary <em>trees</em>, which must <em>blaze</em> in the <em>conflagration</em> of the <em>whole country</em> [note the words of the prophecy, — ‘The third part of <em>trees</em> was <em>burned up</em>’]; and the emperor of the Romans fled before the king of the Goths.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 456.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 456.1</span></p>

His conquests were, for the most part, naval; and his triumphs were “as it were a great mountain burning with fire, cast into the sea.” What figure would better, or even so well, illustrate the collision of navies, and the general havoc of war on the maritime coasts? In explaining this trumpet, we are to look for some events which will have a particular bearing on the commercial world. The symbol used naturally leads us to look for agitation and commotion. Nothing but a fierce maritime warfare would fulfill the prediction. If the sounding of the first four trumpets relates to four remarkable events which contributed to the downfall of the Roman empire, and the first trumpet refers to the ravages of the Goths under Alaric, in this we naturally look for the <em>next</em> succeeding act of invasion which shook the Roman power and conduced to its fall. The next great invasion <em>was</em> that of “the terrible Genseric,” at the head of the Vandals. His career occurred during the years A. D. 428-468. This great Vandal chief had his headquarters in Africa. But, as Gibbon states, “The discovery and conquest of the black nations [in Africa], that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not tempt the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast his eyes toward the sea; he resolved to create a <em>naval power</em>, and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.” From the port of Carthage he repeatedly made piratical sallies, and preyed on the Roman commerce, and waged war with that empire. To cope with this sea monarch, the Roman emperor, Majorian, made extensive naval preparations. Three hundred long galleys, with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels, were collected in the secure and capacious harbor of Cartagena, in Spain. But Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects, envious or apprehensive of their master’s success. Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the unguarded fleet in the bay of Cartagena; many of the ships were sunk, taken, or burned, and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a single day.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 458.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 458.1</span></p>

The army of Heraclius and the fleet of Marcellinus either joined or seconded the imperial lieutenant.... The wind became favorable to the designs of Genseric. He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors and Vandals, and they towed after them many large barks filled with combustible materials. In the obscurity of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened by a sense of their instant danger. Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult. While they labored to extricate themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of the navy, the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valor; and many of the Romans who escaped the fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals.... After the failure of this great expedition, Genseric again became the tyrant of the sea; the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia were again exposed to his revenge and avarice; Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience; he added Sicily to the number of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the final extinction of the empire of the West.” — <em>Gibbon</em>,<em> Vol. III</em>, pp. 495-498.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 459.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 459.5</span></p>

Still, however, though the Roman sun was extinguished, its subordinate luminaries shone faintly while the senate and consuls continued.

The city that had ruled the world, as if in mockery of human greatness, was conquered by the eunuch Narses, the successor of Belisarius. He defeated the Goths (A.

The glory of Rome had long departed; its provinces one after another been rent from it; the territory still attached to it become like a desert; and its maritime possessions, and its fleets and commerce been annihilated. Little remained to it but the vain titles and insignia of sovereignty. And now the time was come when these too were to be withdrawn. Some twenty years or more from the death of Attila, and much less from that of Genseric (who, ere his death, had indeed visited and ravaged the eternal city in one of his maritime marauding expeditions, and thus yet more prepared the coming consummation), about this time, I say, Odoacer, chief of the Heruli, — a barbarian remnant of the host of Attila, left on the Alpine frontiers of Italy, — interposed with his command that the <em>name</em> and the <em>office of Homan emperor of the West</em>, should be abolished. The authorities bowed in submission to him. The last phantom of an emperor — one whose name, <em>Romulus Augustus</em>, was singularly calculated to bring in contrast before the reflective mind the past glories of Rome and its present degradation — abdicated; and the senate sent away the imperial insignia to Constantinople, professing to the emperor of the East that one emperor was sufficient for the whole of the empire. Thus of the Roman imperial sun, that third which appertained to the Western empire was eclipsed, and shone no more. I say, That <em>third</em> of its orb which appertained to the Western empire; for the Apocalyptic fraction is literally accurate. In the last arrangement between the two courts, the whole of the Illyrian third had been made over to the <em>Eastern</em> division. Thus in the West ‘the extinction of the empire’ had taken place; the night had fallen.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 465.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 465.3</span></p>

The senate of Rome continued to assemble as usual. The consuls were appointed yearly, one by the Eastern emperor, one by Italy and Rome. Odoacer himself governed Italy under a title (that of <em>patrician)</em> conferred on him by the Eastern emperor. And as regarded the more distant Western provinces, or at least considerable districts in them, the tie which had united them to the Roman empire was not altogether severed. There was still a certain, though often faint, recognition of the supreme imperial authority. The moon and the stars might seem still to shine on the West with a dim reflected light. In the course of the events, however, which rapidly followed one on the other in the next half century, these, too, were extinguished. Theodoric, the Ostrogoth, on destroying the Heruli and their kingdom at Rome and Ravenna, ruled in Italy from A. D. 493 to 526 as an independent sovereign; and on Belisarius’s and Narses’s conquest of Italy from the Ostrogoths (a conquest preceded by wars and desolations in which Italy, and above all its seven-hilled city, were for a time almost made desert), the Roman senate was dissolved, the consulship abrogated. Moreover, as regards the barbaric princes of the Western provinces, their independence of the Roman imperial power became now more distinctly averred and understood. After above a century and a half of calamities unexampled almost, as Dr. Robertson most truly represents it, in the history of nations, the statement of Jerome, — a statement couched under the very Apocalyptic figure of the text, but prematurely pronounced on the first taking of Rome by Alaric, — might be considered as at length accomplished: ‘Clarissimum terrarum <em>lumen</em> extinctum est,’ ‘The world’s glorious <em>sun</em> has been extinguished;’ and that, too, which our own poet has expressed, still under the same beautifully appropriate Apocalyptic imagery, —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 466.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 466.1</span></p>

Only one class of persons is directly brought to view in the text; namely, those who have not the seal of God in their foreheads; and the preservation of those who have the seal of God is brought in only by implication. Accordingly, we do not learn from history that any of these were involved in any of the calamities inflicted by the Saracens upon the objects of their hate. They were commissioned against another class of men. And the destruction to come upon this class of men is not put in contrast with the preservation of other men, but only with that of the fruits and verdure of the earth; thus, Hurt not the grass, trees, nor any green thing, but only a certain class of men. And in fulfilment, we have the strange spectacle of an army of invaders sparing those things which such armies usually destroy, namely, the face and productions of nature; and, in pursuance of their permission to hurt those men who had not the seal of God in their foreheads, cleaving the skulls of a class of religionists with shaven crowns, who belonged to the synagogue of Satan.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 474.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 474.4</span></p>

Against these, the arms of the Mohammedans were directed. And it seems to us that there is a peculiar fitness, if not design, in describing them as those who had not the seal of God in their foreheads; inasmuch as that is the very church which has robbed the law of God of its seal, by tearing away the true Sabbath, and erecting a counterfeit in its place. And we do not understand, either from the prophecy or from history, that those persons whom Abubeker charged his followers not to molest were in possession of the seal of God, or necessarily constituted the people of God. Who they were, and for what reason they were spared, the meager testimony of Gibbon does not inform us, and we have no other means of knowing; but we have every reason to believe that none of those who had the seal of God were molested, while another class, who emphatically had it not, were put to the sword; and thus the specifications of the prophecy are amply met.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 475.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 475.1</span></p>

The heads of the horses were, in appearance, as the heads of lions, to denote their strength, courage, and fierceness; while the last part of the verse undoubtedly has reference to the use of gunpowder and firearms for purposes of war, which were then but recently introduced.

Hence the anxiety of the Sultan Mahomet to find that which would remove the obstacle. ‘Canst thou cast a cannon,’ was his question to the founder of cannon that deserted to him, ‘of size sufficient to batter down the wall of Constantinople?’ Then the foundry was established at Adrianople, the cannon cast, the artillery prepared, and the siege began.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 483.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 483.2</span></p>

The image before the mind of John would seem to have been that he saw the horses belching out fire and smoke, and, what was equally strange, he saw that their power of spreading desolation was connected with the tails of the horses.

In 1838 the trouble between the sultan and his Egyptian vassal was for the time being restrained by the influence of the foreign ambassadors. In 1839, however, hostilities were again commenced, and were prosecuted until, in a general battle between the armies of the sultan and Mehemet, the sultan’s army was entirely cut up and destroyed, and his fleet taken by Mehemet and carried into Egypt. So completely had the sultan’s fleet been reduced, that, when the war again commenced in August, he had only two first-rates and three frigates as the sad remains of the once powerful Turkish fleet. This fleet Mehemet positively refused to give up and return to the sultan, and declared that if the powers attempted to take it from him, he would burn it. In this posture affairs stood, when, in 1840, England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia interposed, and determined on a settlement of the difficulty; for it was evident that, if let alone, Mehemet would soon become master of the sultan’s throne.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 485.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 485.3</span></p>

A conference of these powers was held in London, the Sheik Effendi Bey Likgis being present as Ottoman plenipotentiary. An ultimatum was drawn up to be presented to the pasha of Egypt, whereby the sultan was to offer him the hereditary government of Egypt, and all that part of Syria extending from the Gulf of Suez to the Lake of Tiberias together with the province of Acre, for life; he on his part to evacuate all other parts of the sultan’s dominions then occupied by him, and to return the Ottoman fleet. In case he refused this offer from the sultan, the four powers were to take the matter into their own hands, and use such other means to bring him to terms as they should see fit.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 486.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 486.1</span></p>

The sultan despatched Rifat Bey on a government steamer to Alexandria, to communicate the ultimatum to the pasha. It was put into his hands, and by him taken in charge, <em>on the eleventh day of August</em>, 1840! On the same day, a note was addressed by the sultan to the ambassadors of the four powers, inquiring what plan was to be adopted in case the pasha should refuse to comply with the terms of the ultimatum, to which they made answer that provision had been made, and <em>there was no necessity of his alarming himself about any contingency that might arise</em>. This day the period of three hundred and ninety-one years and fifteen days, allotted to the continuance of the Ottoman power, ended; and <em>where was the sultan’s independence</em>? — GONE! Who had the supremacy of the Ottoman empire in their hands? — The <em>four great powers</em>; and that empire has existed ever since only by the <em>sufferance</em> of these Christian powers.

We read in Daniel of a book which was closed up and sealed to a certain time: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.45062#45062" data-link="1965.45062">Daniel 12:4</a>. Since this book was closed up only <em>till</em> the time of the end, it follows that <em>at</em> the time of the end the book would be opened; and as its closing was mentioned in prophecy, it would be but reasonable to expect that in the predictions of events to take place at the time of the end, the <em>opening</em> of this book would also be mentioned. There is no book spoken of as closed up and sealed except the book of Daniel’s prophecy; and there is no account of the opening of that book, unless it be here in the 10th of Revelation. We see, furthermore, that in both places the contents ascribed to the book are the same. The book which Daniel had directions to close up and seal had reference to time: “How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?” And when the angel of this chapter comes down with the little book open, on which he bases his proclamation, he gives a message in relation to time: “Time shall be no longer.” Nothing more could be required to show that both expressions refer to one book, and to prove that the little book which the angel had in his hand open, was the book of the prophecy of Daniel.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 488.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 488.4</span></p>

All that now remains on this point is to ascertain when the time of the end commenced; and the book of Daniel itself furnishes data from which this can be done.

This is declared to reach to the time of the end. It ended A. D. 1798, where the 1260 years of papal rule expired. There the time of the end commenced, and the book was opened. And since that time, many have run to and fro, and knowledge on these prophetic subjects has marvelously increased.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 489.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 489.1</span></p>

The points of identity between them are easily seen: (1) They both have a special message to proclaim; (2) they both utter their proclamation with a loud voice; (3) they both use similar language, referring to the great Creator as the maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and the things that are therein; and (4) they both proclaim time, one swearing that time should be no more, and the other proclaiming that the hour of God’s Judgment has come. But the message of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63114#63114" data-link="1965.63114">Revelation 14:6</a> is located this side of the commencement of the time of the end. It is a proclamation of the hour of God’s Judgment come, and hence must have its application in the last generation. Paul did not preach the hour of Judgment come. Luther and his coadjutors did not preach it. Paul reasoned of a Judgment to come, indefinitely future; and Luther placed it at least three hundred years off from his day. Moreover, Paul warns the church against any such preaching as that the hour of God’s Judgment has come, until a certain time. In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.60498#60498" data-link="1965.60498">2 Thessalonians 2:1-3</a>, he says: “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that <em>man of sin be revealed</em>, the son of perdition,” etc. Here Paul introduces to our view the man of sin, the little horn, the papacy, and covers with a caution the whole period of his supremacy, which, as already noticed, continued 1260 years, ending in 1798. In 1798, therefore, the restriction against proclaiming the day of Christ at hand ceased; in 1798, the time of the end commenced, and the seal was taken from the little book. Since that period, therefore, the angel of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63104#63104" data-link="1965.63104">Revelation 14</a> has gone forth proclaiming the hour of God’s Judgment come; and it is since that time, too, that the angel of chapter 10 has taken his stand on sea and land, and sworn that time shall be no more. Of their identity there can now be no question; and all the arguments which go to locate the one, are equally effective in the case of the other. We need not enter into any argument here to show that the present generation is witnessing the fulfillment of these two prophecies. In the preaching of the advent, more especially from 1840 to 1844, began their full and circumstantial accomplishment. The position of this angel, one foot upon the sea and the other on the land, denotes the wide extent of his proclamation by sea and by land. Had this message been designed for only one country, it would have been sufficient for the angel to take his position on the land only. But he has one foot upon the sea, from which we may infer that his message would cross the ocean, and extend to the various nations and divisions of the globe; and this inference is strengthened by the fact that the Advent proclamation, above referred to, did go to every missionary station in the world. More on this under chapter 14.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 490.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 490.1</span></p>

We must acquiesce in the directions given to John concerning them, and leave them where he left them, sealed up, unwritten, and consequently to us unknown. There is, however, a conjecture extant in relation to them, which may not inappropriately be mentioned here. It is that what the seven thunders uttered is the experience of the Adventists engaged in that movement, embracing their sore disappointment and trial. Something, evidently, was uttered which it would not be well for the church to know; and for God to have given an inspired record of the Advent movement in advance, would have been simply to defeat that movement, which we verily believe was in all its particulars an accomplishment of his purposes, and according to his will. Why, then, any mention of the seven thunders at all? Following out the above-noticed conjecture, the conclusion would be that we, having met in our history with sudden, mysterious, and unexpected events, as startling and strange as thunders from an unclouded sky, might not give up in utter perplexity, inferring, as we may, that all is in the order and providence of God, since something of this nature was sealed up, and hidden from the church.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 491.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 491.2</span></p>

Not many years from that date, then, the mystery of God is to be finished. The great event, whatever it is, is right upon us. Some closing and decisive work, with whatever of importance and solemnity it bears in its train, is near at hand. There is an importance connected with the finishing of any of the works of God. Such an act marks a solemn and important era. Our Saviour, when expiring upon the cross, cried, “It is finished” (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.54772#54772" data-link="1965.54772">John 19:30</a>); and when the great work of mercy for fallen man is completed, it will be announced by a voice from the throne of God, proclaiming, in tones which roll like thunder through all the earth, the solemn sentence, “It is done!” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63194#63194" data-link="1965.63194">Revelation 16:17</a>.

In this he refers to his Epistle to the Galatians, where he recorded what had been given him “by revelation,” in these words: “But I certify you, brethren, that the <em>gospel</em> which was preached of me is not after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but <em>by the revelation of Jesus Christ</em>.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59279#59279" data-link="1965.59279">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>.

In the last verse of chapter 10, the angel gave to John, as a representative of the church, a new commission. In other words, as already shown, we have in that verse a prophecy of the third angel’s message. Now follows testimony showing what the nature of that message is to be. It is connected with the temple of God in heaven, and is designed to fit up a class of people as worshipers therein. The temple here cannot mean the church; for the church is brought to view in connection with this temple as “them that worship therein.” The temple is therefore the literal temple in heaven, and the worshipers the true church on earth. But of course these worshipers are not to be measured in the sense of ascertaining the hight and circumference of each one in feet and inches; they are to be measured as <em>worshipers</em>; and character can be measured only by some standard of right, namely, a law, or rule of action. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the ten commandments, the standard which God has given by which to measure “the whole duty of man,” are embraced in the measuring rod put by the angel into the hands of John; and in the fulfillment of this prophecy, this very law has been put, under the third message, into the hands of the church. This is the standard by which the worshipers of God are now to be tested.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 497.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 497.2</span></p>

To measure any object requires that we give especial attention to that object; so, doubtless, the call to rise and measure the temple of God is a prophetic command to the church to give the subject of the temple, or sanctuary, a special examination. But how is this to be done with a measuring rod given to the church? With the ten commandments alone we could not do it. When, however, we take the entire message, we find ourselves led by it to an examination of the sanctuary on high, with the commandments of God and the ministration of Christ connected therewith. Hence we conclude that the measuring rod, taken as a whole, is the special message now given to the church, which embraces the great truths peculiar to this time, including the ten commandments. By this message, our attention has been called to the temple above, and through it the light and truth on this subject has come out. Thus we measure the temple and the altar, or the ministration connected with the temple, the work and the position of our great High Priest; and we measure the worshipers with that portion of the rod which relates to character, namely, the ten commandments.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 498.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 498.1</span></p>

Matters pertaining to the court are of less consequence now. It is given to the Gentiles. That the court refers to this earth is proved thus: The court is the place where the victims were slain whose blood was to be ministered in the sanctuary. The antitypical victim must die in the antitypical court; and he died on Calvary in Judea. Having thus introduced the Gentiles, the attention of the prophet is directed to the great feature of Gentile apostasy; namely, the treading down of the holy city forty and two months during the period of papal supremacy. He is then directed to the condition of the word of God, the truth, and the church during that time. Thus by an easy and natural transition, we are carried back into the past, and our attention is called to a new series of events.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 498.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 498.2</span></p>

In the verses last quoted, the prophet glances forward to the full establishment of the kingdom of God. Although the seventh trumpet has begun to sound, it may not yet be a fact that the great voices in heaven have proclaimed that the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, except it be in anticipation of the speedy accomplishment of this event; but the seventh trumpet, like the preceding six, covers a period of time; and the transfer of the kingdoms from earthly powers to Him whose right it is to reign, is the principal event to occur in the early years of its sounding; hence this event, to the exclusion of all else, here engages the mind of the prophet.

God takes to him his great power, and forever crushes the rebellion of this revolted earth, establishes Christ upon his own throne, and remains himself supreme over all. This picture being completed, we are pointed back, in verse 18, to the state of the nations, the judgment to fall upon them, and the final destiny of both saints and sinners. This field of vision having been scanned, we are taken back once more in the verse now under notice, and our attention is called to the close of the priesthood of Christ, the last scene in the work of mercy for a guilty world. The temple is opened; the second apartment of the sanctuary is entered. We know it is the holy of holies that is here opened; for the ark is seen; and in that apartment alone the ark was deposited. This took place at the end of the 2300 days, when the sanctuary was to be cleansed, the time when the prophetic periods expired, and the seventh angel commenced to sound. Since that time, the people of God have seen by faith the open door in heaven, and the ark of God’s testament there. They are endeavoring to keep every precept of the holy law written upon the tables therein deposited. And that the tables of the law are there, just as in the ark in the sanctuary erected by Moses, is evident from the terms which John uses in describing the ark. He calls it the “ark of his testament.” The ark was called the ark of the covenant, or testament, because it was made for the express purpose of containing the tables of the testimony, or ten commandments. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.4502#4502" data-link="1965.4502">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.4962#4962" data-link="1965.4962">31:18</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.10547#10547" data-link="1965.10547">Deuteronomy 10:2, 5</a>. It was put to no other use, and owed its name solely to the fact that it contained the tables of the law. If the tables were not therein, it would not be the ark of his (God’s) testament, and could not truthfully be so called. Yet John, beholding the ark in heaven under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, still calls it the “ark of his testament,” affording unanswerable proof that the law is still there, unaltered in one jot or tittle from the copy which for a time was committed to the care of men in the typical ark of the tabernacle during the Mosaic dispensation.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 507.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 507.4</span></p>

By the figure of prolepsis, the church is represented as fully organized, with its twelve apostles, before the man child, Christ, appeared upon the scene. This is easily accounted for by the fact that it was to be thus constituted immediately after Christ should commence his ministry; and he is more especially connected with this church than with that of the former dispensation.

If the twelve stars with which the woman is crowned, here used symbolically, denote the twelve apostles, then the stars thrown down by the dragon before his attempt to destroy the man child, or before the Christian era, may denote a portion of the rulers of the Jewish people. That the sun, moon, and stars are sometimes used in this symbolic sense, we have already had evidence in chapter 8:12. The dragon being a symbol, could deal only with symbolic stars; and the chronology of the act here mentioned would confine it to the Jewish people. Judea became a Roman province sixty-three years before the birth of the Messiah. The Jews had three classes of rulers, — kings, priests, and the Sanhedrim. A third of these, the kings, were taken away by the Roman power. Philip Smith, History of the World, Vol. III, p. 181, after describing the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans and Herod, and its capitulation in the spring of B. C. 37, after an obstinate resistance of six months, says: “Such was the end of the Asmonean dynasty, exactly 130 years after the first victories of Judas Maccabaeus, and in the seventieth year from the assumption of the diadem by Aristobulus I.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 510.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 510.4</span></p>

Was any such attempt made? and who made it? No formal answer to this question need be given to any one who has read how Herod, in a fiendish effort to destroy the infant Jesus, sent forth and slew all the children in Bethlehem, from two years old and under. But who was Herod? — A Roman governor. From Rome, Herod derived his power. Rome ruled at that time over all the world (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.50968#50968" data-link="1965.50968">Luke 2:1</a>), and was therefore the responsible party in this transaction. Moreover, Rome was the only earthly government which at that time <em>could</em> be symbolized in prophecy, for this very reason that its dominion was universal. It is not, therefore, without the most conclusive reason that the Roman empire is considered by Protestant commentators generally to be the power indicated by the great red dragon. And it may be a fact worth mentioning that during the second, third, fourth, and fifth centuries of the Christian era, next to the eagle the dragon was the principal standard of the Roman legions; and that dragon was painted red, as though, in faithful response to the picture held up by the seer of Patmos, they would exclaim to the world, We are the nation which that picture represents.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 511.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 511.3</span></p>

Herod could not destroy him; the combined powers of earth and hell could not overcome him; and though held for a time under the dominion of the grave, he rent its cruel bands, opened a way of life for mankind, and was caught up to God and his throne, or ascended up to heaven in the sight of his disciples, leaving to them, by the words of the angels, this sweetest of all his promises, that like as he was taken away from them, so he would come again.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 512.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 512.1</span></p>

In the 7th verse it is equally plain that we are carried back into previous ages. How far? — To the time first introduced in the chapter, — the days of the first advent. “And there was war in heaven,” the same heaven where the woman and the dragon were seen at first; but they were actors in scenes that took place here upon the earth; hence we understand this war to be located in the same place. And to what point are we carried back? — Evidently to the commencement of Christ’s ministry here upon earth. To prove that Michael is Christ, see <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62597#62597" data-link="1965.62597">Jude 9</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.60408#60408" data-link="1965.60408">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.53524#53524" data-link="1965.53524">John 5:28, 29</a>; and that this was a special time of warfare between him and Satan need not be argued.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 513.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 513.2</span></p>

It is the Devil and Satan. But this is not the same as the dragon of verses 3 and 4. That was a great <em>red</em> dragon, with seven <em>heads</em> and ten <em>horns</em>, and seven <em>crowns</em> upon his heads. It would be most grotesque to try to apply this to Satan personally. Satan is not said anywhere in the Bible to be <em>red</em>, and he is not blessed with the number of <em>heads</em> and <em>horns</em> there stated; and while he might, as the god of this world, have one crown, how would he manage to wear seven? But all these features are very appropriate as applied to pagan Rome.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 513.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 513.3</span></p>

And why a similar symbol is also employed to represent Rome with some of its peculiar features is evident. It was because Rome, as a universal empire, was then the only possible general agent to carry out Satan’s will in the earth. But there is no occasion to confound the two symbols.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 514.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 514.1</span></p>

He came to Christ with specious temptations, in hope of overcoming him; he tried in various ways to destroy him during his ministry; and when he had succeeded in laying him in the tomb, he endeavored, in malignant triumph, to hold him there. But in every encounter the Son of God came off triumphant; and he sends back this gracious promise to his faithful followers: “To him that over-cometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as <em>I also overcame</em>, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” This shows us that Jesus while on earth waged a warfare, and obtained the victory. Satan saw his last effort fail, his last scheme miscarry. He had boasted that he would overcome the Son of God in his mission to this world, and thus render the plan of salvation an ignominious failure; and well he knew that if he was foiled in this his last desperate effort to thwart the work of God, his last hope had perished, and all was lost.

But we are unable to harmonize this view with the testimony before us. Thus, in verse 13 we read: “And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.” This shows that just as soon as the Devil saw that he was cast out, he turned his wrath against the woman, the church, which, not far from that time, fled into the wilderness. When Satan therefore found himself thus overthrown, the man child had already been brought forth, or, in other words, the first advent of Christ had taken place. Hence this war and defeat of Satan, taking place this side of the Christian era, and not a great length of time before the church went into the wilderness in 538, cannot be his fall from heaven before the creation of the world; though that was a war in heaven.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 514.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 514.4</span></p>

One was his first rejection from heaven; another, when Christ overcame him at his first advent; and there will be another in the future, when he is cast into the bottomless pit, and shut up for a thousand years. And on each successive occasion, we behold a regularly increasing limitation of his power. He falls a degree lower in every succeeding combat. The first time, as we may plainly infer from certain scriptures, the contest was between him and God the Father (see <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62230#62230" data-link="1965.62230">2 Peter 2:4</a>); the second time between him and Christ the Son, as in the scripture before us; while the third time an angel suffices to accomplish the work of his humiliation. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63334#63334" data-link="1965.63334">Revelation 20:1, 2</a>. Since his first contest, he has not been permitted to rise to the dignity of contending with the Father; since the second, he has not had the privilege, if such it may be called, of a personal encounter with the Son. The war mentioned in the scripture now before us is between the Devil and Michael, Christ. The great effort of the former against the latter, personally, was during his mission here on earth; and Christ’s great personal victory over him was in that very contest.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 515.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 515.1</span></p>

It here doubtless denotes condition rather than place; and the expression would then signify that they were here humiliated, and never to regain their former position. They had suffered a terrible defeat, which Christ describes by saying, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” The hope which he had all along cherished, of overcoming the Son of man when he took upon himself our nature, had forever perished. His power was limited. He could no more aspire to a personal encounter with the Son of God, — a fact which hitherto had given, in a comparative degree, dignity and prestige to his position. Henceforth the church (the woman) is the object of his malice, and he resorts to all those nefarious means against her that would naturally characterize a baffled and hopeless rage.

The great victory had been won by Christ which put the question of their establishment forever at rest.

Suffice it to say that here we are again carried back to the time when Satan became fully aware that he had utterly failed in all his attempts against the Lord of glory in his earthly mission; and seeing this, he turned with tenfold fury, as already noticed, upon the church which Christ had established. Then we have again brought to view the church going into that condition here denominated being “in the, wilderness.” This must denote a state of seclusion from the public gaze, and of concealment from her foes. That church which during all the dark ages trumpeted her lordly commands into the ears of listening Christendom, and flaunted her ostentatious banners before gaping crowds, was not the church of Christ; it was the body of the mystery of iniquity. The “mystery of godliness” was God manifested here as a man; the “mystery of iniquity” was a man pretending to be God. This was the great apostasy, the mongrel produced by the union of heathenism and Christianity. The true church was out of sight; in secret places they worshiped God; the caves and the hidden recesses of the valleys of the Piedmont may be taken as representative places, where the truth of the gospel was sacredly cherished from the rage of its foes.

Luther nailed his theses to the door of the church at Wittenberg; and the pen with which he wrote them, according to the symbolic dream of the good elector Frederick of Saxony, did indeed span the continent, and shake the triple crown on the pope’s head. Princes began to espouse the cause of the Reformers. It was the dawning of religious light and liberty, and God would not suffer the darkness to swallow up its radiance. Tetzel, the indulgence-peddler, swelled and bellowed with wrath, and Pope Leo roared with rage; but all in vain. The spell was broken. Men found that the bulls and anathemas of the pope fell harmless at their feet, just as soon as they dared exercise their God-given right to regulate their consciences by his word alone. Defenders of the true faith multiplied. And soon there was enough Protestant soil found in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, England, Norway, and Sweden, to swallow up the flood of papal fury, and rob it of its power to harm the church.

The scene opens with the church, under the symbol of a woman, anxiously longing for the promise to be fulfilled that the seed of the woman, the Lord of glory, should appear among men. The dragon stood before the woman for the purpose of devouring her child. His evil design is thwarted, and the child is caught up to God and his throne. A period follows in which the church suffers severe oppression from this dragon power. And though in this part of the scene the prophet occasionally glances forward, once even down almost to the end, because all the enemies of the church were to be actuated by the spirit of the dragon, yet in verse 1 of chapter 13 we are carried back to the time when the leopard beast, the successor of the dragon, commences his career. From this power, for the long period of 1260 years, the church suffers war and persecution. Following this period of oppression, the church has another conflict, brief, but sharp and severe, with the two-horned beast. Then comes deliverance; and the prophecy closes with the church brought safely through all her persecutions, and standing victorious with the Lamb on Mount Zion.

The other characters are her persecutors, and are introduced simply because they are such. And here, as an introductory inquiry, we raise the question, Who, or what is it that persecutes the true church? — It is a false or apostate church. What is it that is ever warring against true religion? — It is a false and counterfeit religion. Who ever heard of the civil power, merely, of any nation, persecuting the people of God? Governments may war against other governments, to avenge some wrong, real or imaginary, or to acquire territory and extend their power, as nations have often warred against the Jews; but governments do not persecute (mark the word — do not <em>persecute</em>) people on account of their religion, unless under the control of some opposite and hostile system of religion. But the powers introduced in this prophecy, — the dragon, the leopard beast, and the two-horned beast, — are all <em>persecuting</em> powers. They are actuated by rage and enmity against the people and church of God. And this fact is of itself sufficiently conclusive evidence that in each of these powers the ecclesiastical or religious element is the controlling power.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 522.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 522.1</span></p>

The Roman empire, is the undeniable answer. But this is not enough. No one would be satisfied with this answer and no more. It must be more definite. We then add, The Roman empire in its <em>pagan farm</em>, to which all must also agree. But just as soon as we say <em>pagan</em>, we introduce a religious element; for paganism is one of the hugest systems of counterfeit religion that Satan ever devised. The dragon, then, is so far an ecclesiastical power that the very characteristic by which it is distinguished is a false system of religion. And what made the dragon persecute the church of Christ? — It was because Christianity was prevailing against paganism, sweeping away its superstitions, overturning its idols, and dismantling its temples. The <em>religious</em> element of that power was touched, and persecution was the result.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 522.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 522.2</span></p>

What does that symbolize? The answer still is, The Roman empire. But the dragon symbolized the Roman empire, and why does not the same symbol represent it still? — Ah! there has been a change in the <em>religious character</em> of the empire; and this beast symbolizes Rome in its professedly Christian form. And it is this <em>change of religion</em>, and this alone, which makes a change in the symbol necessary. This beast differs from the dragon only in that he presents a different <em>religious</em> aspect.

By what power was pagan Rome succeeded? We all know that it was by papal Rome. It matters not to our present purpose when or by what means this change was effected; the great fact is apparent, and is acknowledged by all, that the next great phase of the Roman empire after its pagan form was its papal. It would not be correct, therefore, to say that pagan Rome gave its seat and power to a form of government merely civil, having no religious element whatever. No stretch of the imagination can conceive of such a transaction. But two phases of empire are here recognized; and in the prophecy, Rome is pagan until Rome is papal. The statement that the dragon gave to the leopard beast his seat and power, is further evidence that the dragon of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63036#63036" data-link="1965.63036">Revelation 12:3</a> is not a symbol of Satan personally; for Satan has not abdicated in favor of any other malevolent being; and he has not given up his seat to any earthly power.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 523.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 523.2</span></p>

But the prophecy does not say so. It is the leopard beast <em>alone</em> with which the dragon has to do. It is to that beast <em>alone</em> that he gives his power, seat, and great authority. It is that beast that has a head that is wounded to death, which is afterward healed; that beast that the whole world wonders after; that beast that receives a mouth speaking blasphemies, and that wears out the saints for 1260 years; and all this before the succeeding power, the two-horned beast, comes upon the stage of action at all. The leopard beast alone, therefore, symbolizes the Roman empire in its papal form, the controlling influence being ecclesiastical.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 523.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 523.3</span></p>

We are held to this conclusion by the very obvious principle that whatever is spoken in prophecy of the symbol of any government, applies to that government only while it is represented by that symbol. Now Rome is represented by two symbols, the dragon and the leopard beast, because it has presented two phases, the pagan and the papal; and whatever is said of the dragon applies to Rome only in its pagan form, and whatever is said of the leopard beast applies to Rome only in its professedly Christian form. But Rome was pagan in John’s day, who lived under the sixth or imperial head. This shows us at once that six of the heads, including the imperial, belong to the dragon; and if it was any one of these heads which was wounded to death, then it was one of the heads of the dragon, or one of the forms of government that belonged to Rome in its pagan form, and not one of the heads of the beast; and John should have said, I saw one of the heads of the dragon wounded to death. But he says that it was one of the heads of the beast that was wounded to death. In other words, this wound fell upon some form of government that existed in the Roman empire after its change, from paganism to Christianity. But after this change, there was but one head, and that was the papal. <a class="btn btn-primary" tabindex="0" href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-original-title="" title="">*</a> Thus it is placed beyond controversy that it was none other than the papal head that was wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed.

In the records of the Bible and of secular history, we find data from which to deduce this rule respecting the prophetic mention of earthly governments; namely, whenever the relations of God’s people to any nation are such that a true history of the former, which is the object of all revelation, could not be given without a notice of the latter, such nation is mentioned in prophecy. And all these conditions are certainly fulfilled in our government. No nation has ever attracted more attention, excited more profound wonder, or given promise of greater eminence or influence. And certainly here, if anywhere on the globe, are to be found a strong array of Christians, such as are the salt of the earth and the light of the world, whose history could not be written without mention of that government under which they live and enjoy their liberty.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 528.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 528.2</span></p>

It was at the time when this beast went into captivity, or was killed (politically) with the sword (verse 10), or (which we suppose to be the same thing) had one of its heads wounded to death (verse 3), that John saw the two-horned beast coming up. If the leopard beast, as we have conclusively proved, signifies the papacy, and the going into captivity met its fulfillment in the temporary overthrow of the popedom by the French in 1798, then we have the time definitely specified when we are to look for the rise of this power. The expression “coming up” must signify that the power to which it applies was but newly organized, and was then just rising into prominence and influence.

Thus the American government added over fourteen hundred thousand square miles of territory, during the fifty years named, more than any other single nation, and over eight hundred thousand more than were added, during that time, by all the other nations of the earth put together.

John’s words are, “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns <em>like a lamb</em>.” Why does not John simply say, “He had two horns”? Why does he add, “like a lamb”?

John calls it “another beast.” It is a symbol in addition to, and different from, the papal beast which the prophet had just had under consideration; that is, it symbolizes a power separate and distinct from that which is denoted by the preceding beast. This which John calls “another beast” is certainly no part of the first beast; and the power symbolized by it is likewise no part of that which is intended by that beast. This is fatal to the claim of those, who, to avoid the application of this symbol to our own government, say that it denotes some phase of the papacy; for in that case it would be a part of the preceding, or leopard beast.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 531.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 531.5</span></p>

The lion of the seventh chapter also represents Babylon; the bear, Medo-Persia; the leopard, Grecia; and the great and terrible beast, Rome. The horn with human eyes and mouth, which appears in the second phase of this beast, represents the papacy, and covers its history down to the time when it was temporarily overthrown by the French in 1798. In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44812#44812" data-link="1965.44812">Daniel 8</a>, likewise, the ram represents Medo-Persia; the he-goat, Grecia; and the little horn, Rome.

John says he saw the beast coming up “out of the earth.” And this expression must have been designedly used to point out the contrast between the rise of this beast and that of other national prophetic symbols. The four beasts of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44755#44755" data-link="1965.44755">Daniel 7</a> and the leopard beast of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63067#63067" data-link="1965.63067">Revelation 13</a> all arose out of the sea.

Let us see. A short time before the great Reformation in the days of Martin Luther, not four hundred years ago, this Western Hemisphere was discovered. The Reformation awoke the nations, that were fast fettered in the galling bonds of superstition, to the fact that it is the heaven-born right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. But rulers are loth to lose their power, and religious intolerance still oppressed the people. Under these circumstances, a body of religious heroes at length determined to seek in the wilds of America that measure of civil and religious freedom which they so much desired. In pursuance of their noble purpose, one hundred of these voluntary exiles landed from the Mayflower, on the coast of New England, Dec. 22, 1620. “Here,” says Martyn, “New England was born,” and this was “its first baby cry, — a prayer and a thanksgiving to the Lord.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 536.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 536.3</span></p>

Then commenced the struggle of the American colonies for independence. In 1776, they declared themselves a free and independent nation. In 1777, delegates from the thirteen original States, — New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, — in Congress assembled, adopted Articles of Confederation. In 1783, the war of the Revolution closed with a treaty of peace with Great Britain, whereby the independence of the United States was acknowledged, and territory ceded to the extent of 815,615 square miles. In 1787, the Constitution was framed, and ratified by the foregoing thirteen States; and on the 1st of March, 1789, it went into effect. Then the American ship of state was fairly launched, with less than one million square miles of territory, and about three million souls. Thus are we brought to the year 1798, when this government is introduced into prophecy. And now, passing over a little more than a hundred years, to the last decade of the nineteenth century, the territory of the United States government has expanded to 3,678,392 square miles, and its population has increased to about 70,000,000 people. Its growth in all industrial pursuits, agricultural productions, cattle raising, newspapers, schools, production of the precious metals, and wealth of all kinds which pertain to a civilized people, has been equally remarkable, and furnishes an ample basis for the application of the prophecy.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 537.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 537.1</span></p>

In describing this power, John says that it had “two horns like a lamb.” The horns of a lamb indicate, first, youthfulness, and secondly, innocence and gentleness. As a power which has but recently arisen, the United States answers to the symbol admirably in respect to age; while no other power, as has already been proved, can be found to do this. And considered as an index of power and character, it can be decided what constitutes the two horns of the government, if it can be ascertained what is the secret of its strength and power, and what reveals its apparent character, or constitutes its outward profession. The Hon. J. A. Bingham gives us the clue to the whole matter when he states that the object of those who first sought these shores was to found “what the world had not seen for ages; viz., a church without a pope, and a state without a king.” Expressed in other words, this would be a government in which the ecclesiastical should be separate from the civil power, and civil and religious liberty reign supreme.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 537.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 537.2</span></p>

Article IV, sec. 4 of the Constitution of the United States, reads: “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government.” Article VI: “No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.” The first amendment of the Constitution (Art. I) begins as follows: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” These articles profess the amplest guarantee of <em>civil</em> and <em>religious</em> liberty, the entire and perpetual separation of church and state; and what better symbols of them could be given than “two horns like a lamb”? In what other country can be found a condition of things which would meet so completely this feature of the symbol?</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 538.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 538.1</span></p>

This is shown by the absence of crowns both upon its head and its horns. A crown is an appropriate symbol of a kingly or monarchical form of government; and the absence of crowns, as in this case, would suggest a government in which the power is not vested in any such ruling member, but is, per consequence, lodged in the hands of the people.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 538.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 538.2</span></p>

From verse 14 we learn that appeal is made to the people when any national action is to be performed: “Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that <em>they</em> should make an image to the beast,” etc. Were the government a monarchy, national questions would hardly be submitted in this unqualified manner, to the people; and the fact that appeal is here made to the people shows that the form of the government is such that the power is vested in their hands; and this is emphatically the case in the United States government, but not in any other government to which any one could reasonably think of applying this symbol. This is another strong link in the chain of evidence that this symbol must apply to the United States of America.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 539.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 539.1</span></p>

It has been shown that the preceding beast symbolized the papacy; and of the two-horned beast we read that he causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast. But in all Catholic countries, the people voluntarily worship the beast, or obey the dictates of Catholicism, without being “caused,” or compelled, to do so by the government. The fact that the people of this government do not render this worship till caused to do so by the civil power, shows that the religion they entertain is not Catholicism. As an almost inevitable consequence, it follows that it is Protestantism; for these are the only two religions of any consequence in Christendom. The United States is a Protestant nation, and meets the requirements of the prophecy admirably in this respect.

The full development of the beast, or the establishment of papal supremacy, dates from the famous letter of Justinian, which was made effective in A. D. 538, constituting the pope the head of the church and the corrector of heretics. The papacy was a church clothed with civil power, — an ecclesiastical body having authority to punish all dissenters with confiscation of goods, imprisonment, torture, and death. What would be an image of the papacy? — Another ecclesiastical establishment clothed with similar power. How could such an image be formed in the United States? Let the Protestant churches be clothed with power to define and punish heresy, to enforce their dogmas under the pains and penalties of the civil law, and should we not have an exact representation of the papacy during the days of its supremacy?</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 546.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 546.3</span></p>

The answer is, There are certain points which they hold in common, and which are sufficient to form a basis of co-operation. Chief among these may be mentioned the doctrine of the conscious state of the dead and the immortality of the soul, which is both the foundation and superstructure of Spiritualism; and also the doctrine that the first day of the week is the Christian Sabbath.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 546.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 546.4</span></p>

The mark, as literally used, signified that the person receiving it was the servant of, acknowledged the authority of, or professed allegiance to, the person whose mark he bore.

Daniel, describing that power under the symbol of a little horn, speaks of it as waging a special warfare against God, wearing out the saints of the Most High, and thinking to change times and laws. The prophet expressly specifies on this point: “He shall <em>think</em> to change times and laws.” These laws must certainly be the laws of the Most High. To apply it to human laws, and make the prophecy read, “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change human laws,” would be doing evident violence to the language of the prophet. But apply it to the laws of God, and let it read, “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and laws of the Most High,” and all is consistent and forcible. The Hebrew has דָּת (<em>dath</em>), law, and the Septuagint reads, νόμος (<em>nomos</em>) in the singular, “the law,” which more directly suggests the law of God. The papacy has been able to do more than merely “think” to change human laws. It has changed them at pleasure. It has annulled the decrees of kings and emperors, and absolved subjects from allegiance to their rightful sovereigns. It has thrust its long arm into the affairs of nations, and brought rulers to its feet in the most abject humility. But the prophet beholds greater acts of presumption than these. He sees it endeavor to do what it was not able to do, but could only think to do; he sees it attempt an act which no man, nor any combination of men, can ever accomplish; and that is, to change the law of the Most High.

And now we ask the reader to ponder carefully the question how he can exalt himself <em>above</em> God. Search through the whole range of human devices, go to the extent of human effort; by what plan, by what move, by what claim, could this usurper exalt himself above God? He might institute any number of ceremonies, he might prescribe any form of worship, he might exhibit any degree of power; but so long as God had requirements which the people felt bound to regard in preference to his own, so long he would not be <em>above</em> God. He might enact a law, and teach the people that they were under as great obligations to that as to the law of God; then he would only make himself <em>equal</em> with God. But he is to do more than this; he is to attempt to raise himself <em>above</em> him. Then he must promulgate a law which <em>conflicts</em> with the law of God, and demand obedience to his own law in preference to God’s law. There is no other possible way in which he could place himself in the position assigned in the prophecy. But this is simply to change the law of God; and if he can cause this change to be adopted by the people in the place of the original enactment, then he, the law-changer, is above God, the law-maker. And this is the very work that Daniel said he should think to do.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 552.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 552.1</span></p>

And when this is done, what do the people of the world have? They have two laws demanding obedience, — one, the law of God as originally enacted by him, an embodiment of his will, and expressing his claims upon his creatures; the other, a revised edition of that law, emanating from the pope of Rome, and expressing his will. And how is it to be determined which of these powers the people honor and worship? — It is determined by the law which they keep. If they keep the law of God as given by him, they worship and obey God. If they keep the law as changed by the papacy, they worship that power. But further: the prophecy does not say that the little horn, the papacy, should set aside the law of God, and give one entirely different. This would not be to change the law, but simply to give a new one. He was only to attempt a <em>change</em>, so that the law that comes from God, and the law that comes from the papacy, are precisely alike, excepting the change which the papacy has made in the former. They have many points in common. But none of the precepts which they contain in common can distinguish a person as the worshiper of either power in preference to the other. If God’s law says, “Thou shalt not kill,” and the law as given by the papacy says the same, no one can tell by a person’s observance of that precept whether he designed to obey God rather than the pope, or the pope rather than God. But when a precept that has been changed is the subject of action, then whoever observes that precept as originally given by God, is thereby distinguished as a worshiper of God; and he who keeps it as changed is thereby marked as a follower of the power that made the change. In no other way can the two classes of worshipers be distinguished. From this conclusion, no candid mind can dissent; but in this conclusion we have a general answer to the question, “What constitutes the mark of the beast?” and that answer is simply this: The <em>mark</em> of the beast is the <em>change</em> which the beast has attempted to make in the law of God.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 553.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 553.1</span></p>

By the law of God, we mean the moral law, the only law in the universe of immutable and perpetual obligation, — the law of which Webster says, defining the term according to the sense in which it is almost universally used in Christendom, “The moral law is summarily contained in the decalogue, written by the finger of God on two tables of stone, and delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 553.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 553.2</span></p>

Here are several variations from the decalogue as found in the Bible. Which of them, if any, constitutes the change of the law intended in the prophecy? or are they all included in that change? Let it be borne in mind, that, according to the prophecy, he was to <em>think</em> to change times and laws. This plainly conveys the idea of <em>intention</em> and <em>design</em>, and makes these qualities essential to the change in question. But respecting the omission of the second commandment, Catholics argue that it is included in the first, and hence should not be numbered as a separate commandment; and on the tenth they claim that there is so plain a distinction of ideas as to require two commandments; so they make the coveting of a neighbor’s wife the ninth command, and the coveting of his goods the tenth.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 554.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 554.1</span></p>

They expressly claim a change here, and also that the change has been made by the church. A few quotations from standard Catholic works will make this matter plain.

And no truly enlightened Protestant will thank him; for if he succeeds, he only shows that the papacy has not done the work which it was predicted that it should do, and so that the prophecy has failed, and the Scriptures are unreliable. The matter would better stand as the prophecy has it, and the claim which the pope unwittingly puts forth would better be granted.

So, when the prophecy affirms that a certain power shall change the law of God, and in due time that very power arises, does the work foretold, and then openly claims that he has done it, what need have we of further evidence? The world should not forget that the great apostasy foretold by Paul has taken place; that the man of sin for long ages held almost a monopoly of Christian teaching in the world; that the mystery of iniquity has cast the darkness of its shadow and the errors of its doctrines over almost all Christendom; and that out of this era of error and darkness and corruption, the theology of our day has come. Would it, then, be anything strange if there were yet some relics of popery to be discarded ere the reformation will be complete? A. Campbell (Baptism, p. 15), speaking of the different Protestant sects, says: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 558.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 558.1</span></p>

True to his purpose to exalt himself above God, he undertakes to change that commandment which, of all others, is the fundamental commandment of the law, the one which makes known who the lawgiver is, and contains his signature of royalty. The fourth commandment does this; no other one does. Four others, it is true, contain the word <em>God</em>, and three of them the word <em>Lord</em>, also. But who is this Lord God of whom they speak? Without the fourth commandment, it is impossible to tell; for idolaters of every grade apply these terms to the multitudinous objects of their adoration. With the fourth commandment to point out the Author of the decalogue, the claims of every false god are annulled at one stroke; for the God who here demands our worship is not any created being, but the One who created all things. The maker of the earth and sea, the sun, and moon, and all the starry host, the upholder and governor of the universe, is the One who claims, and who, from his position, has a right to claim, our supreme regard in preference to every other object. The commandment which makes known these facts is therefore the very one we might suppose that power which designed to exalt itself above God would undertake to change. God gave the Sabbath as a memorial of himself, a weekly reminder to the sons of men of his work in creating the heavens and the earth, a great barrier against atheism and idolatry. It is the signature and seal of the law. This the papacy has torn from its place, and erected in its stead, on its own authority, another institution, designed to serve another purpose.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 558.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 558.3</span></p>

Some who have long been taught to regard this institution with reverence will perhaps start back with little less than feelings of horror at this conclusion. We have not space, nor is this, perhaps, the place, to enter into an extended argument on the Sabbath question, and an exposition of the origin and nature of the observance of the first day of the week. Let us submit this one proposition: If the seventh day is still the Sabbath enjoined in the fourth commandment; if the observance of the first day of the week has no foundation whatever in the Scriptures; if this observance has been brought in as a Christian institution, and designedly put in place of the Sabbath of the decalogue by that power which is symbolized by the beast, and placed there as a badge and token of its power to legislate for the church, — is it not inevitably the mark of the beast? The answer must be in the affirmative. But these hypotheses are all certainties. <a class="btn btn-primary" tabindex="0" href="javascript:void(0)" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-original-title="" title="">*</a></span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 559.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 559.1</span></p>

We answer, Not so! And we are sorry to say that some professedly religious teachers, though many times corrected, persist in misrepresenting us on this point. We have never so held; we have never so taught. Our premises lead to no such conclusions. Give ear: The mark and worship of the beast are enforced by the two-horned beast. The receiving of the mark of the beast is a specific act which the two-horned beast is to cause to be done. The third message of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63120#63120" data-link="1965.63120">Revelation 14</a> is a warning mercifully sent out in advance to prepare the people for the coming danger. There can therefore be no worship of the beast, nor reception of his mark, such as the prophecy contemplates till it is <em>enforced</em> by the two-horned beast. We have seen <em>intention</em> was essential to the change which the papacy has made in the law of God, to constitute it the mark of that power; so <em>intention</em> is necessary in the adoption of that change to make it, on the part of any individual, the reception of that mark. In other words, a person must adopt the change knowing it to be the work of the beast, and receive it on the authority of that power, in opposition to the requirement of God.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 560.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 560.1</span></p>

The third angel proclaims the commandments of God, leading men to the true in the place of the counterfeit. The dragon is stirred, and so controls the wicked governments of the earth that all the authority of human power shall be exerted to enforce the claims of the man of sin. Then the issue is fairly before the people. They are required to keep, on the one hand, the true Sabbath; on the other, a counterfeit. For refusing to keep the true, the message threatens the unmingled wrath of God; for refusing the false, earthly governments threaten them with persecution and death. With this issue before the people, what does he do who yields to the human requirement? — He virtually says to God, I know your claims, but I will not heed them. I know that the power I am required to worship is anti-Christian, but I yield to it to save my life. I renounce your allegiance, and bow to the usurper.

An ecclesiastical organization composed of a greater or less number of the different sects of our land, with some degree of coalition also between these bodies and Roman Catholicism, together with the promulgation and enforcement of a general Sunday-Sabbath law, would fulfill what the prophecy sets forth in reference to the image and the mark of the beast; and these movements, or their exact equivalent, the prophecy calls for.

But at that time no sign appeared above or beneath, at home or abroad, — no token was seen, no indication existed, that such an issue would ever be made. But there was the prophecy, and that must stand. The United States government had given abundant evidence, by its location, the time of its rise, the manner of its rise, and its apparent character, that it was the power symbolized by the two-horned beast. There could be no mistake in the conclusion that it was the very nation intended by that symbol. This being so, it must take the course and perform the acts foretold. But here were predictions which could be fulfilled by nothing less than the above-named movement respecting church and state, and the enforcement of the papal Sabbath as a mark of the beast.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 562.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 562.2</span></p>

The only course for the humble, confiding student of prophecy to pursue in such cases is to take the light as it is given, and believe the prophecy in all its parts. So the stand was boldly taken; and open proclamation has been made from that day to this, that such a work would be seen in the United States. With every review of the argument, new features of strength have been discovered in the application; and amid a storm of scornful incredulity we have watched the progress of events, and awaited the hour of fulfilment.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 562.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 562.3</span></p>

Organizations called Sabbath Committees have been formed in various places, and have labored zealously, by means of books, tracts, speeches, and sermons, to create a strong public sentiment in behalf of Sunday. Making slow progress through moral suasion, they seek a shorter path to the accomplishment of their purposes through political power. And why not?

The political functions of this great body are centered in a “Christian Citizenship League,” which boasts that it will have branches in every State, county, city, village, and hamlet, in the United States, and see to it that only Christian men are put into office. What remarkable “conversions” will then take place! How politicians will become “Christians,” and the “millennium” hasten on!

Congress has already turned its back on its sacred trust to fawn upon the church influence so rapidly rising. When the managers of the World’s Fair of 1893, in Chicago, asked Congress for an appropriation in their behalf, churchmen brought their influence to bear upon the national legislators, and induced them to make it a condition of the gift that the gates of the Fair be closed on Sunday. In carrying this point a most remarkable scene occurred. A senator called for a Bible and caused the clerk to read the fourth commandment of the decalogue; whereupon grave statesmen argued, and at length by vote decided, that the day enjoined by that commandment as the Sabbath, is <em>Sunday!</em></span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 573.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 573.4</span></p>

(See Amendment I.) It broke down the barriers against the union of church and state, and opened the flood-gates for all the evils that invariably accompany such a union. The religious-amendment clergy hailed the event as a great triumph, and now openly boast that they have Congress in their hands, and can compel it to do their bidding. How far away, then, is that “image,” the coming of which the Scriptures have foretold? The outlines of every element necessary for its erection are clearly developed; all the agents sufficient for an assault upon the bulwarks of American liberty are being rapidly enrolled and drilled; the outposts have already been carried; and as these pages go to press, the leaders of this fatal revolution are again clamoring around the citadel of the nation’s strength. It needs but another step to turn the nation entirely from its high commission as the conservator of the principles of the gospel; that is, to “render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s,” and lead it to form and foster a religious tyranny which will fetter the consciences of men, and crush out soul liberty among the people. And this tyranny will be as much more wicked than any that has gone before it, as men have now more light, and the experience of all the past to guide them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 574.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 574.1</span></p>

On the statute-books of most of the States of the American Union, are found Sunday laws; and as the agitation in behalf of the seventh day increases, religious zealots are not slow to use these laws to put the machinery of persecution in operation. Observers of the seventh day manifest no defiance of these laws, in laboring on Sunday, as the higher law of God gives them an unalienable right to do; and they studiously refrain from disturbing others, or in any way infringing upon their rights, by boisterous or offensive labor. Yet it is construed to be “disturbance,” if they are even <em>seen</em> anywhere at work, or even if it is known that they are at work anywhere, though <em>unseen</em> or <em>unheard</em>. If no other way appears for detection, they are searched out by ministers or church-members, or the police acting under their direction. Then follow arrest, conviction, and penalty by fine, imprisonment, or the chain-gang. Up to Jan. 1, 1896, ninety arrests of this kind had been made, some of them under circumstances of great oppression and cruelty, and prisoners had served an aggregate of nearly fifteen hundred days in jail and chain-gangs. And from the windows of some of these jails these very seventh-day keepers, who were there confined in “durance vile,” for not resting on Sunday, could behold on Sundays train-loads of workmen going to their labor, picnickers to their frolic, hunters to their game, and railroad cars to their traffic. But these, it is to be observed, were not keepers of the seventh day. National Reformers, years ago, professed to smile at the apprehensions of those who keep the seventh day, that their work would result in persecution. Now they only smile a little more grimly and call for stricter laws — for the seventh-day people.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 574.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 574.2</span></p>

Every conceivable invention is therefore resorted to, to make it appear that it is not religious persecution at all, but only the question of obedience to civil law. One of these inventions is that Sunday is only a civil institution, and its enforcement only a police regulation, a civil requirement necessary for the public good. But this is impossible; for every one knows that Sunday in its origin, history, and very nature, is a religious institution. No claims in its behalf would ever have been heard of, but for its religious basis. Hence any enactment to enforce it by pains and penalties is religious legislation and religious oppression.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 575.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 575.1</span></p>

Every law that does not trench upon the domain of conscience, if it becomes unacceptable to the people, should nevertheless be obeyed, till it can be changed or repealed. But Sunday laws interfere with the conscience of the observer of another day, and for that reason cannot “bear upon all alike.” And no true Christian can make his obedience to God depend upon the permission of his fellow men. It may be said again, In a country like the United States, do not majorities rule? and must not their decisions be obeyed? And the answer again is, Yes, in everything but questions of conscience, but never there. “Render... unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” Men may legislate to guard the mutual rights of all members of society, but no further; and in this they will never infringe upon the rights of any one’s conscience; for a “good” conscience (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62107#62107" data-link="1965.62107">1 Peter 3:21</a>) will never invade the rights of others, like the polygamy of the Mormons, or the human sacrifices of the heathen.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 576.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 576.1</span></p>

In the further development of religious truth, it is now found that these laws forbid men to render obedience to what the Bible requires of them, and thus conflict with their unalienable rights. Such laws, therefore, the Christian cannot regard, and the government, to be true to its professed principles, should wipe them off the statute-books wherever found. But this the religio-political clergy will not permit; and the nation is doomed; for it will thus put itself in line with the religious despotisms of the past; and the cry will go up from God’s suffering children, “It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.32667#32667" data-link="1965.32667">Psalms 119:126</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 576.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 576.2</span></p>

Thus they make, by what rule we do not understand, L stand for 30; A, for 1; T, for 300; E, for 5; I, for 10; N, for 50; O, for 70; and S, for 200; which numbers, added together, make 666.

The first five verses of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63104#63104" data-link="1965.63104">Revelation 14</a> are an instance of this. The 13th chapter closed with the people of God, a small and apparently weak and defenseless company, in deadly conflict with the mightiest powers of earth which the dragon is able to muster to his service. A decree is passed, backed up by the supreme power of the land, that they shall worship the image and receive the mark, under pain of death if they refuse to comply. What can the people of God do in such a conflict and in such an extremity? What will become of them? Glance forward with the apostle to the very next scene in the program, and what do we behold? — The very same company standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb, — a victorious company, harping on symphonious harps their triumph in the court of heaven.

Yet we are not to understand that they never had any connection with these churches; for it is only at a certain time that people become defiled by them. In chapter 18:4, we find a call issued to the people of God while they are in Babylon, to come out, <em>lest</em> they become partakers of her sins. Heeding that call, and leaving her connection, they escape the defilement of her sins.

When God commissions his ministers to announce to the world that the hour of his Judgment is come, that Babylon has fallen, and that whoever worships the beast and his image must drink of his wrath poured out unmingled into the cup of his indignation, — a threatening more terrible than any other which can be found in the Scriptures of truth, — no man, except at the peril of his soul, can treat these warnings as non-essential, passing them by with neglect and disregard. Hence the necessity for the most earnest endeavor in every age, and especially in the present age, when so many evidences betoken the soon-coming of earth’s final crisis, to understand the work of the Lord, lest we lose the benefit of the present truth.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 587.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 587.1</span></p>

The very nature of the message forbids the idea that it could have been given in the apostles’ days. They did not proclaim that the hour of God’s Judgment had come. If they had, it would not have been true, and their message would have been stamped with the infamy of falsehood. They did have something to say, however, respecting the Judgment; but they pointed to an indefinite future for its accomplishment. In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.47846#47846" data-link="1965.47846">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.47943#47943" data-link="1965.47943">11:21-24</a>, a quotation from Christ’s own words, the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah, Tyre, Sidon, Chorazin, and Capernaum, was located indefinitely in the future from that day.

Here some seem disposed to make quite a determined stand, claiming that Luther and his colaborers gave the first message, and that the two following messages have been given since his day. This is a question to be decided by historical fact rather than by argument; and hence we inquire for the evidence that the Reformers made any such proclamation. Their teaching has been very fully recorded, and their writings preserved. When and where did they arouse the world with the proclamation that the hour of God’s Judgment had come? We find no record that such was the burden of their preaching at all. On the contrary, it is recorded of Luther that he placed the Judgment some three hundred years in the future from his day. Such records ought to be decisive, so far as the Reformers are concerned.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 589.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 589.1</span></p>

By “future age” is meant a period subsequent to the second advent; and the reason urged for locating the message in that age is the fact that John saw the angel flying through heaven, immediately after having seen the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with the 144,000, which is a future event. If the book of Revelation were one consecutive prophecy, there would be force in this reasoning; but as it consists of a series of independent lines of prophecy, and as it has already been shown that one such chain ends with verse 5 of this chapter, and a new one begins with verse 6, the foregoing view cannot be urged. To show that the message cannot have its fulfillment in a future age, it will be sufficient to remark: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 589.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 589.2</span></p>

The apostolic commission extended only to the “harvest,” which is the end of the world. If, therefore, this angel with the “everlasting gospel” comes after that event, he preaches another gospel, and subjects himself to the anathema of Paul in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59273#59273" data-link="1965.59273">Galatians 1:8</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 589.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 589.3</span></p>

The second message cannot, of course, be given before the first; but the second message announces the fall of Babylon, and a voice is heard from heaven after that, saying, “Come out of her, my people.” How absurd to locate this after the second advent of Christ, seeing that all God’s people, both living and dead, are at that time caught up to meet the Lord in the air, to be thenceforward forever with him. They cannot be called out of Babylon after this. Christ does not take them to Babylon, but to the Father’s house, where there are many mansions. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.54397#54397" data-link="1965.54397">John 14:2, 3</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 590.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 590.1</span></p>

A glance at the third angel’s message, which must be fulfilled in a future age if the first one is, will still further show the absurdity of this view. This message warns against the worship of the beast, which refers, beyond question, to the papal beast. But the papal beast is destroyed and given to the burning flame when Christ comes.

This is a complete demonstration of the fact that the message must be given prior to the first resurrection; for after that event all who have a part therein (and this includes all, both living and dead, who are not assigned to the second death) become as the angels of God, and can die no more.

The argument on the two preceding points has done much to establish the present proposition; for if the message has not been given in the past, and cannot be given in the future after Christ comes, where else can we locate it but in the present generation, if we are in the last days, as we suppose? Indeed, the very nature of the message itself confines it to the last generation of men. It proclaims the hour of God’s Judgment come. But the Judgment pertains to the closing up of the work of salvation for the world; and the proclamation announcing its approach can therefore be made only as we come near the end. It is further shown that the message belongs to the present time when it is proved that this angel is identical with the angel of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62970#62970" data-link="1965.62970">Revelation 10</a>, who utters his message in this generation.

On this point we refer to a movement of which it would now be hard to find any one who is wholly ignorant. It is the great Advent movement of the present century. As early as 1831, Wm. Miller, of Low Hampton, N. Y., by an earnest and consistent study of the prophecies, was led to the conclusion that the gospel dispensation was near its close. He placed the termination, which he thought would occur at the end of the prophetic periods, about the year 1843. This date was afterward extended to the autumn of 1844. (See diagram and argument under <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44913#44913" data-link="1965.44913">Daniel 9:24-27</a>.) We call his investigations a consistent study of the prophecies, because he adopted that rule of interpretation which will be found lying at the base of every religious reformation, and of every advance movement in prophetic knowledge; namely, to take all the language of the Scriptures, just as we would that of any other book, to be literal, unless the context or the laws of language require it to be understood figuratively; and to let scripture interpret scripture. True, on a vital point he made a mistake, as will be explained hereafter; but in principle, and in a great number of particulars, he was correct. He was on the right road, and made an immense advance over every theological system of his day. When he began to promulgate his views, they met with general favor, and were followed by great religions awakenings in different parts of the land. Soon a multitude of colaborers gathered around his standard, among whom may be mentioned such men as F. G. Brown, Chas. Fitch, Josiah Litch, J. V. Himes, and others, who were then eminent for piety, and men of influence in the religious world. The period marked by the years 1840-1844 was one of intense activity and great progress in this work. A message was proclaimed to the world which bore every characteristic of a fulfillment of the proclamation of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63114#63114" data-link="1965.63114">Revelation 14:6, 7</a>. The preaching was emphatically such as might be called the everlasting (age-lasting) gospel. It pertained to the closing up of this age, and the incoming of the everlasting age (αἰών) of the King of righteousness. It was that gospel of the kingdom which Christ declared should be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then the end should come. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.48938#48938" data-link="1965.48938">Matthew 24:14</a>. The fulfillment of either of these scriptures involves the preaching of the nearness of the end. The gospel could not be preached to all nations as a <em>sign</em> of the end, unless it was understood to be such, and the proximity of the end was at least one of its leading themes. The <em>Advent Herald</em> of Dec. 14, 1850, well expressed the truth on this point in the following language: —</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 591.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 591.1</span></p>

The burden of this angel was to be the <em>same</em> gospel which had been before proclaimed; but connected with it was the additional motive of the <em>proximity</em> of the kingdom — ‘saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his Judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.’ Verse 7.

Those who became interested in this movement went forth to meet the Bridegroom; that is, they were aroused to expect the coming of Christ, and to look and wait for his return from heaven. The Bridegroom tarried. The first point of expectation, the close of the year 1843, which according to Jewish reckoning ended in the spring of 1844, passed by, and the Lord did not come. While he tarried, they all slumbered and slept. Surprised by the unexpected doubt and uncertainty into which they were thrown, the interest of the people began to wane, and their efforts to flag. At midnight there was a cry made, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh! go ye out to meet him.” Midway between the spring of 1844, where it was at first supposed that the 2300 days would terminate, and that point in the autumn of 1844 to which it was afterward ascertained that they really extended, just such a cry as this was suddenly raised. Involuntarily, this very phraseology was adopted: “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh.” The cause of this sudden arousing was the discovery that the great prophetic period of 2300 days (years) of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44838#44838" data-link="1965.44838">Daniel 8:14</a>, did not end in the spring of 1844, but would extend to the autumn of that year, and consequently that the time at which they supposed they were warranted to look for the appearing of the Lord had not passed by, but was indeed at the door. At the same time, the relation between the type and the antitype relating to the cleansing of the sanctuary was partially seen. The prophecy declared that at the end of the 2300 days, the sanctuary should be cleansed; and as in the type the sanctuary was cleansed on the tenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish year, that point in the autumn of 1844 was accordingly fixed upon for the termination of the 2300 years. It fell on the 22d of October. Between the midsummer of 1844, when the light on these subjects was first seen, and the day and month above named when the 2300 years terminated, perhaps no movement ever exhibited greater activity than this respecting the soon coming of Christ, and in no cause was ever more accomplished in so short a space of time. A religious wave swept over this country, and the nation was stirred as no people have been stirred since the opening of the great Reformation of the sixteenth century. This was called the “seventh-month movement,” and was more particularly confined to the United States and Canada.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 593.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 593.2</span></p>

The Jewish church was disappointed when, at the close of the work of John the Baptist, Jesus presented himself as the promised Messiah. And the trusting disciples were most sadly disappointed when he whom they expected to deliver Israel was by wicked hands taken and slain. And after his resurrection, when they expected him to restore again the kingdom to Israel, they could not but be disappointed when they understood that he was going away to his Father, and that they were to be left for a long season to tribulation and anguish. But disappointment does not prove that God has no hand in the guidance of his people. It should lead them to correct their errors, but it should not lead them to cast away their confidence in God. It was because the children of Israel were disappointed in the wilderness that they so often denied divine guidance.

There the cleansing of the sanctuary began; but this did not bring Christ to this earth, for the earth is not the sanctuary; and its cleansing does not involve the destruction of the earth, for it is accomplished with the blood of a sacrificial offering, not with fire.

This is not the coming of Christ to this earth; for it is a coming which precedes the marriage; but the marriage, that is, the reception of the kingdom (see on chapter 21), must precede his coming to this earth to receive to himself his people, who are to be the guests at the marriage supper. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.52523#52523" data-link="1965.52523">Luke 19:12</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63303#63303" data-link="1965.63303">Revelation 19:7-9</a>.

But this question of fitness for the kingdom can be determined only by the investigative Judgment of the sanctuary. This closing work in the sanctuary, therefore, which is the cleansing of the sanctuary, and the atonement, is nothing else than the examination of the guests to see who have on the wedding garment; and, consequently, until this work is finished, it is not determined who are “ready” to go in to the marriage. “They that were <em>ready</em> went in with him to the marriage.” By this short expression we are carried from the time when the Bridegroom comes to the marriage, entirely through the period of the cleansing of the sanctuary, or the examination of the guests; and when this is concluded, probation will end, and the door will be shut.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 599.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 599.1</span></p>

Babylon is not confined to the Romish Church. That this church is a very prominent component part of great Babylon, is not denied. The descriptions of chapter 17 seem to apply very particularly to that church. But the name which she bears on her forehead, “Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth,” reveals other family connections. If this church is the mother, who are the daughters? The fact that these daughters are spoken of, shows that there are other religious bodies besides the Romish Church which come under this designation. Again, there is to be a call made in connection with this message, “Come out of her, my people” (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63242#63242" data-link="1965.63242">Revelation 18:1-4</a>); and as this message is located in the present generation, it follows, if no other church but the Romish is included in Babylon, that the people of God, as a body, are now found in the commission of that church, and are to be called out.

Babylon is not the city of Rome. The argument relied upon to show that the city of Rome is the Babylon of the Apocalypse runs thus: “The angel told John that the woman which he had seen was the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth, and that the seven heads of the beast are seven mountains upon which the woman sitteth.” And then, taking the city and the mountains to be literal, and finding Rome built upon just seven hills, the application is made at once to literal Rome.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 602.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 602.1</span></p>

So in the case before us. “The seven heads are seven mountains,” and “The woman is that great city;” and it will not be difficult to show that the mountains and the city are both used symbolically.

Were the city of Rome the Babylon of the Apocalypse, what nonsense should we have in chapter 18:1-4; for in this case the fall of Babylon would be the overthrow and destruction of the city, in fact, its utter consumption by fire, according to verse 8. But mark what takes place after the fall. Babylon becomes a habitation of devils, the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. How can this happen to a city after that city is destroyed, even being utterly burned with fire? But worse still, after all this a voice is heard, saying, “Come out of her, my people.” Are God’s people in Rome? — Not to any great extent, even in her best estate. But how many can we suppose to be there, to be called out, after the city is burned with fire?

Babylon signifies the universal worldly church. Having seen that it cannot be any one of the only other three possible objects to which it could be applied, it must mean this. But we are not left to this <em>a priori</em> kind of reasoning on this subject. Babylon is called a woman. A woman, used as a symbol, signifies a church. The woman of chapter 12 was interpreted to mean a church. The woman of chapter 17 should undoubtedly be interpreted as signifying also a church. The character of the woman determines the character of the church represented, a chaste woman standing for a pure church, a vile woman for an impure or apostate church. The woman Babylon is herself a harlot, and the mother of daughters like herself. This circumstance, as well as the name itself, shows that Babylon is not limited to any single ecclesiastical body, but must be composed of many. It must take in all of a like nature, and represent the entire corrupt or apostate church of the earth. This will perhaps explain the language of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63288#63288" data-link="1965.63288">Revelation 18:24</a>, which represents that when God makes requisition upon great Babylon for the blood of his martyrs, in her will be found “the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all” that have been slain upon the earth. The Greek Church is the established church of Russia and Greece; the Lutheran Church is the established church of Prussia, Holland, Sweden, Norway, and a part of the smaller German states; England has Episcopacy for her state religion; and other countries have their established religions, and zealously oppose dissenters. Babylon has made all nations drunken with the wine of her fornication, that is, her false doctrines; it can therefore symbolize nothing less than the universal worldly church.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 603.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 603.4</span></p>

So the great religions of the world may be arranged under three heads. The first, oldest, and most wide-spread is paganism, separately symbolized under the form of a dragon; the second is the great Romish apostasy, symbolized by the beast; and the third is the daughters, or descendants from that church. Under this head comes the two-horned beast, though that does not embrace it all. War, oppression, conformity to the world, the worship of mammon, the creed-power, pursuit of pleasure, and the maintenance of very many errors of the old Romish Church, identify, with sad and faithful accuracy, the great body of the Protestant churches as an important constituent part of this great Babylon.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 604.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 604.1</span></p>

Rome, having the power, destroyed vast multitudes of those whom she adjudged heretics. The Protestant church has shown the same spirit. Witness the burning of Michael Servetus by the Protestants of Geneva with John Calvin at their head. Witness the long-continued oppression of dissenters by the Church of England. Witness the hanging of Quakers and whipping of Baptists even by the Puritan fathers of New England, themselves fugitives from like oppression by the Church of England. But these, some may say, are things of the past. Very true; yet they show that when persons governed by strong religious prejudice have the power to coerce dissenters, they cannot forbear to use it — a state of things which we look for in this country under a further fulfillment of the closing prophecy of chapter 13.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 605.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 605.1</span></p>

Christ forbade his people to seek after the treasures of this world. But the popular church, as a body, exhibits greater eagerness for wealth than do worldlings themselves. In how many churches does mammon bear rule! Christ says, “Be not ye called Rabbi,” that is, master, or doctor; “for one is your Master, even Christ.” To do this is to partake of that same spirit which has led aspiring men to assume to be the head of the church, the successors of St. Peter, the vicegerent of Christ, and a god upon earth. Yet how many in the Protestant church, in imitation of the Romish, adopt the title of “Reverend,” which in our version of the Scriptures is applied to God alone: “Holy and reverend is his name.” But not content with this, some become “Very Reverend,” and “Right Reverend,” and “Doctors of Divinity.” The New Testament speaks in the most decided terms against adornments and extravagance in dress; yet where shall we look for a display of the latest fashions, the most costly attire, the most gaudy adornments, the richest diamonds, and the most dazzling jewelry, except in a fashionable assembly in a Protestant church on a pleasant Sunday? Such is now the state of the religious world, that many, in pursuit of their vocation as lawyers, doctors, politicians, merchant kings, etc., seek through the avenue of church connection success in business, honor in society, high offices in the nation, and lucrative positions everywhere. And much more of this will be seen, when, as already explained, church and state shall be united in America, and a religious profession shall become a qualification for political office. To adopt the form of godliness from such motives must be most abominable in the sight of God; yet these very classes are welcomed by the churches, because it will make them still more popular.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 605.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 605.2</span></p>

To come to the United States, look at all the arts and devices resorted to, to draw the multitude, not to convert and save them, but to gain their patronage and influence.

Instead of this, look at the confusion that exists in the Protestant world, the many sectional walls that divide it up into a network of societies, and the many creeds, discordant as the languages of those who were dispersed at the tower of Babel. God is not the author of all these. It is just this state of things which the word <em>Babylon</em>, as a descriptive term, appropriately designates. It is evidently used for this very purpose, and not at all as a term of reproach. Instead of being stirred with feelings of resentment when this term is mentioned, people should rather examine their position, to see if in faith or practice they are guilty of any connection with this great city of confusion, and if so, separate at once therefrom.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 606.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 606.2</span></p>

Paganism was only apostasy and corruption in the beginning, and is so still; and no moral fall is possible there. Catholicism has been for centuries about as low in the scale as it is possible for a church to sink. No room for a moral fall in that church. Two great branches of Babylon were, therefore, when the second message became due, in so low a condition morally that a further declension with them was scarcely possible. Not so, however, with the Protestant branch of this great city. These churches, which commenced the great work of reformation from papal corruption, had done some noble work. They had run well for a season. They reached a moral plane vastly higher than that of the other divisions named. They were, in a word, in such a position that with them a moral fall was possible. The conclusion is therefore inevitable that the message announcing the fall had reference almost wholly to the Protestant churches.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 610.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 610.3</span></p>
                    <p class="egw_content_wrapper" book_id="12861" id="3197" data-para-id="12861.3197" data-refcode="DAR 611.1"><span class="egw_content" data-refcode="12861.3197" data-translate="[]" data-refcode-old="DAR 611.1">The question may then be asked why this announcement was not made sooner, if so large a portion of Babylon, the pagan and papal divisions, had been so long fallen. And the answer is at hand: Babylon, as a whole, could not be said to be fallen so long as one division of it remained unfallen. It could not be announced, therefore, till a change for the worse came over the Protestant world, and the truth, through which alone the path of progress lay, had been deliberately discarded. But when this took place, and a moral fall was experienced in this last division, then the announcement concerning Babylon as a whole could be made, as it could not have been made before, — “Babylon is fallen.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 611.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 611.1</span></p>

And the answer is, It would apply most pertinently. The fault with Babylon lies in her confusion and false doctrines. Because she industriously propagates these, clinging to them when light and truth which would correct them is offered, she falls. With the Protestant churches, the time had come for an advance to higher religious ground. They could accept the proffered light and truth, and reach the higher attainment, or they could reject it, and lose their spirituality and favor with God, or, in other words, experience a moral fall. The truth which God saw fit to use as an instrument in this work was the first message. The hour of God’s Judgment come, and the approximate second advent of Christ, was the doctrine preached. After listening long enough to see the blessing that attended the doctrine, and the good results that flowed from it, the churches, as a whole, rejected it with scorn and scoffing. They were thereby tested; for they then plainly betrayed the fact that their hearts were with the world, not with the Lord, and that they preferred to have it so. But the message would have healed the evils then existing in the religions world. The prophet exclaims, perhaps with reference to this very time, “We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.41265#41265" data-link="1965.41265">Jeremiah 51:9</a>. Do you ask how we know this would have been the effect of receiving the message? We answer, Because this was the effect with all who did receive it. They came from different denominations, and their denominational barriers were leveled to the ground; conflicting creeds were shivered to atoms; the unscriptural hope of a temporal millennium was abandoned; false views of the second advent were corrected; pride and conformity to the world were swept away; wrongs were made right; hearts were united in the sweetest fellowship; and love and joy reigned supreme. If the doctrine did this for the few who did receive it, <em>it would have done the same for all</em>, <em>if all had received it</em>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 611.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 611.2</span></p>

The result upon those who rejected it will be spoken of by and by; the result upon those who received it, demands mention here.

On the hypothesis that the proclamation of the second coming of Christ was in the order of prophetic fulfilment, and that the message was the “present truth” for that time, the result could not have been different. When a person refuses the light, he necessarily shuts himself in darkness; when he rejects truth, he inevitably forges the shackles of error about his own limbs. Loss of spirituality — a moral fall — must follow. This the churches experienced. They chose to adhere to old errors, and still promulgate their false doctrines among the people. The light of truth must therefore leave them. Some of them felt and deplored the change. A few testimonies from their own writers will describe their condition at that time.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 612.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 612.2</span></p>

Thus, for a time the first message was the only one going forth. The second message was introduced, but that did not put an end to the first. From that time there were two messages. The third followed them, not to supersede them, but only to join with them, so that we now have three messages going forth simultaneously, or, rather, a threefold message, embracing the truths of all three, the last one, of course, being the leading proclamation. Till the work is done, it will never cease to be true that the hour of God’s judgment has come, nor that Babylon has fallen; and these facts still continue to be proclaimed in connection with the truths introduced by the third message.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 619.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 619.4</span></p>

Taking our stand just before the first message was introduced, we see the Protestant religious world sadly in need of reformation. Division and confusion reigned among the churches. They were still clinging to many papal errors and superstitions. The power of the gospel was impaired in their hands. To correct these evils, the doctrine of the second coming of Christ was introduced, and proclaimed with power. They should have received it, and been quickened by it into new life, as they would have been had they received it. Instead of this, they rejected it, and suffered the consequences spiritually. Then followed the second message, announcing the result of that rejection, and declaring what was not only a fact in itself, but a judicial judgment of God upon them for their recreancy in this respect; namely, that God had departed from them, and they had met with a moral fall.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 620.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 620.1</span></p>

And now what follows? — The way is open for a still further retrograde movement, — for deeper apostasy and still greater evils. The powers of darkness will press forward their work, and if the churches still persist in this course of shunning light and rejecting truth, they will soon find themselves worshiping the beast and receiving his mark. This will be the logical sequence of that course of action which commenced with the rejection of the first message. And now another proclamation is sent forth, announcing in solemn tones that if any man shall do this, he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation. That is to say, you rejected the first message, and met with a moral fall; continue to reject truth and disregard the warnings sent out, and you will exhaust God’s last means of grace, and by and by meet with a literal destruction for which there will be no remedy. This is as severe a threatening as God can make to be inflicted in this life, and it is the last. A few will heed it and be saved; the multitude will pass on, and perish.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 620.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 620.2</span></p>

This can represent nothing else than the second coming of Christ. If, therefore, the coming of Christ is at the door, the time has come for the proclamation of this message. There are many who claim the name “Adventist,” and who with voice and pen are earnestly teaching that we are in the last days of time, and that the coming of Christ is at the door; but when we remind them of this prophecy, they are suddenly at sea, without anchor, chart, or compass. They know not what to do with it. They can see as well as we that if what they are teaching respecting the coming of Christ is true, and the Lord is at hand, somewhere — yes, all over the land — should be heard the warning notes of this third message. It is now due; and if it is not now going forth, it follows that we are not in the last days, or that this prophecy is a failure; but this they cannot consistently admit. At the same time, they know that they are not giving it, and they do not claim to be giving it; and they can point to none who are giving it, except it be a certain class who profess that that is the very work they are doing. But to admit the claims of this class would be to condemn themselves. Their perplexity would be deserving of commiseration, were it not that those who will accept an embarrassing dilemma rather than acknowledge the truth, are not justly entitled to much sympathy.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 621.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 621.1</span></p>

Having identified the first message as a leading proclamation with the great Advent movement of 1840-44, and having seen the fulfillment of the second message in connection with that movement in the latter year, let us look at what has transpired since that time.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 621.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 621.2</span></p>

Many gave up the movement entirely; more jumped to the conclusion that the argument on the time was wrong, and immediately went to work to readjust the prophetic periods, and set a new time for the Lord to come — a work in which they have continued more or less to the present time, fixing a new date as each one passed by, to the scandal of the Advent movement, and the discredit, so far as their limited influence extended, of all prophetical study; a few, searching closely and candidly for the cause of the mistake, were confirmed in their views of the providential character of the Advent movement, and the correctness of the argument on the time, but saw that a mistake had been made on the subject of the sanctuary, by which the disappointment could be explained. They learned, that the sanctuary was not this earth, as had been supposed; that the cleansing was not to be by fire; and that the prophecy on this point did not involve the coming of the Lord at all. They found in the Scriptures very clear evidence, that the sanctuary referred to was the temple in heaven, which Paul calls “the sanctuary,” the “true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man;” and that its cleansing, according to the type, would consist of the final ministration of the priest in the second apartment, or most holy place. They then saw that the time had come for the fulfillment of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63029#63029" data-link="1965.63029">Revelation 11:19</a>: “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 622.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 622.1</span></p>

That the ark contained the law was evident from the very name applied to it. It was called “the ark of his testament;” but it would not have been the ark of his “testament,” and it could not have been so called, had it not contained the law. Here, then, was the ark in heaven, the great antitype of the ark, which, during the typical dispensation, existed here on earth; and the law which this heavenly ark contained must consequently be the great original of which the law on the tables in the earthly ark was but a transcript, or copy; and both must read precisely alike, word for word, jot for jot, tittle for tittle. To suppose otherwise would involve not only falsehood, but the greatest absurdity. That law, then, is still the law of God’s government, and its fourth precept, now as in the beginning, demands the observance of the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. No one who admits the argument on the sanctuary pretends to dispute this point. Thus the Sabbath reform was brought to view; and it was seen that whatever had been done in opposition to this law, especially in the introduction of a day of rest and worship which destroyed the Sabbath of Jehovah, must be the work of the papal beast, that power which was to oppose God, and try to exalt himself above him. But this is the very work in reference to which the third angel utters his warning; hence it began to be seen that the period of the third message synchronizes with the period of the cleansing of the sanctuary, which began with the ending of the 2300 days in 1844, and that the proclamation is based on the great truths developed by this subject.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 622.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 622.2</span></p>

The testimony of the Scriptures was found to be clear and abundant; and it did not take a great while to formulate from the truths revealed, definite statements and propositions in explanation of all these points.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 623.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 623.1</span></p>

It is this work, and these agents, against which the third message utters its warning, which is still further proof that this message is now in order, and shows the most conclusive harmony in all these prophecies.

We have found movements which fulfill most strikingly and accurately the first and second messages. Here is another which now challenges the attention of the world as a fulfillment of the third. It <em>claims</em> to be a fulfilment, and asks the world to examine the credentials on which it bases its right to such a claim. Let us look at them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 626.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 626.1</span></p>

The third message warns all against worshiping the beast. So this movement explains how this beast-power has brought into Christendom certain institutions which antagonize the requirements of the Most High, and shows that if we yield to these, we worship this power. “Know ye not,” says Paul, “that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.57268#57268" data-link="1965.57268">Romans 6:16</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 626.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 626.4</span></p>

The third message warns all against receiving the mark of the beast. So this movement makes it the burden of its work to show what the mark of the beast is, and to warn against its reception. It is the more solicitous to do this, because this anti-Christian power has worked so cunningly that the majority are deceived into making unconscious concessions to its authority. It is shown that the mark of the beast is an institution which has been arrayed in Christian garb, and insidiously introduced into the Christian church in such a way as to nullify the authority of Jehovah and enthrone that of the beast. Stripped of all disguises, it is simply setting up a counterfeit Sabbath of its own on the first day of the week, in place of the Sabbath of the Lord on the seventh day, — a usurpation which the great God cannot tolerate, and from which the remnant church must fully clear itself before it will be prepared for the coming of Christ. Hence the urgent warning, Let no man worship the beast or receive his mark.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 626.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 626.5</span></p>

The third message has something to say against the worship of the image of the beast. So this movement speaks of this subject also, telling what the image will be, or at least explaining the prophecy of the two-horned beast, which makes the image, showing that it is our own government; that here the image is to be formed; that the prophecy concerns this generation; and that it is evidently on the very verge of fulfilment.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 627.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 627.1</span></p>

What shall we do with these things? Is this the fulfilment? — It must so stand, unless its claims can be disproved; unless it can be shown that the first and second messages have not been heard; that the positions taken in reference to the beast, image, mark, and worship are not correct; and that all the prophecies, and signs, and evidences which show that the coming of Christ is near, and consequently that this message is due, can be wholly set aside. But this the intelligent Bible student will hardly undertake.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 627.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 627.2</span></p>

It brings out a company of whom it can be said, “Here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” In the very heart of Christendom this work is done; and those who receive the message are rendered peculiar by their practice in reference to the commandments of God. What difference is there in practice, and what only difference, among Christians, in this respect? — Just this; some think that the fourth commandment is kept by devoting the first day of the week to rest and worship; others claim that the seventh day is the one set apart to such duties, and accordingly spend its hours in this manner, resuming on the first day their ordinary labor. No plainer line of demarcation could be drawn between two classes. The time which one class regard as sacred, and devote to religious uses, the other look upon as only secular, and devote to ordinary labor. One class are devoutly resting, the other zealously laboring. One class, pursuing their worldly vocations, find the other class withdrawn from all such pursuits, and the avenue of commercial intercourse abruptly closed. Thus for two days in the week these two classes are kept apart by difference of theory and practice in regard to the fourth commandment. On no other commandment could there be so marked a difference.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 627.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 627.3</span></p>

And in this we find still further evidence that Sunday-keeping is the mark of the beast; for the message, presenting as its chief burden a warning against receiving the mark of the beast, will of course bring its adherents to discard that practice which constitutes the mark, and to adopt the opposite. It does lead them to discard the observance of the first day of the week, and adopt that of the seventh day. In view of this, it is at once seen that there is here more than an inference that Sunday-keeping is the mark of the beast against which it warns us, and the observance of the seventh day, to which it leads us, is its opposite.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 628.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 628.1</span></p>

It was there shown that sign, seal, mark, and token are synonymous terms, and that God takes his Sabbath to be his sign, mark, or seal, in reference to his people. Thus God has a seal, or mark, which is his Sabbath. The beast also has a seal, or mark, which is his Sabbath. One is the seventh day; the other is just as far removed from it as possible, even to the other extremity of the week, namely, the first day. Christendom will at last be divided into just two classes; to wit, those who are sealed with the seal of the living God, that is, have his mark, or keep his Sabbath; and those who are sealed with the seal of the beast, that is, have his mark, or keep his Sabbath. In reference to this issue, the third angel’s message both enlightens and warns us.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 628.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 628.2</span></p>

When is this torment inflicted? Chapter 19:20 shows that at the second coming of Christ there is a manifestation of fiery judgments which may be called a lake of fire and brimstone, into which the beast and false prophet are cast <em>alive</em>. This can refer only to the destruction visited upon them at the commencement, not at the end, of the thousand years. Again, there is a remarkable passage in Isaiah to which we are obliged to refer in explanation of the phraseology of the threatening of the third angel, and which unquestionably describes scenes to take place here at the second advent, and in the desolate state of the earth during the thousand years following. That the language in the Revelation was borrowed from this prophecy can hardly fail to be seen. After describing the Lord’s anger upon the nations, the great slaughter of their armies, the departing of the heavens as a scroll, etc., the prophet says: “For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.37361#37361" data-link="1965.37361">Isaiah 34:8-10</a>. And since it is expressly revealed that there is to be a lake of fire in which all sinners perish at the end of the thousand years, we can only conclude that the destruction of the living wicked at the commencement of this period, and the final doom of all the ungodly at its close, are very similar.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 631.7 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 631.7</span></p>

This is evident from the fact that this punishment is inflicted on this earth, where time is measured by day and night. This is further shown from the passage in Isaiah already referred to, if that is, as above suggested, the language from which this is borrowed, and applies to the same time That language is spoken of the land of Idumea; but whether it be taken to mean literally the land of Edom, south and east of Judea, or to represent, as it doubtless does, this whole earth at the time when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion comes, in either case the scene must eventually terminate; for this earth is finally to be made new, cleansed of every stain of sin, every vestige of suffering and decay, and to become the habitation of righteousness and joy throughout eternal ages. The word αἰών here translated <em>forever</em>, Schrevelius, in his Greek Lexicon, defines thus: “An age; a long period of time; indefinite duration; time, whether longer or shorter.” (For a discussion of the meaning of this term, see the work entitled, Here and Hereafter. <em>Review and Herald</em> Office, Battle Creek, Mich.)</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 632.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 632.1</span></p>

We are fast passing over a line of prophecy which culminates in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven in flaming fire, to take vengeance on his foes, and to reward his saints. Not only so, but we have come so near its accomplishment that the very next link in the chain is this crowning and momentous event. And time never rolls back. As the river does not flinch and fly as it approaches the precipice, but bears all floating bodies over with resistless power; and as the seasons never reverse their course, but summer follows in the path of the budding fig-tree, and winter treads close upon the falling leaf; so we are borne onward and onward, whether we will or not, whether prepared or not, to the unavoidable and irreversible crisis.

What point? — Evidently from the commencement of the message in connection with which this is spoken. But why are those who die after this point of time blessed? There must be some special reason for pronouncing this benediction upon them. Is it not because they escape the time of fearful peril which the saints are to encounter as they close their pilgrimage?

The opinion has already been expressed that literal angels are engaged in the scenes here described. The first three have charge of the three special messages, and may also symbolize a body of religious teachers. The message of the fourth angel is evidently to be uttered after the Son of man, having finished his priestly work, takes his seat upon the white cloud, but before he appears in the clouds of heaven. As the language is addressed to Him who is seated upon the white cloud, having in his hand a sharp sickle ready to reap, it must denote a message of prayer on the part of the church, after their work for the world is done and probation has ceased, and nothing remains but for the Lord to appear and take his people to himself. It is doubtless the day-and-night cry spoken of by our Lord in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.52426#52426" data-link="1965.52426">Luke 18:7, 8</a> in connection with the coming of the Son of man.

And blood comes out of the winepress, even to the horses’ bridles. We know that the wicked are doomed to be swallowed up at last in a flood of all-devouring flame descending from God out of heaven; but what preceding slaughter may take place among the doomed host, we know not. It is not improbable that this language will be literally fulfilled. As the first four angels of this series denoted a marked movement on the part of the people of God, the last two may denote the same; for the saints are to have some part to act in meting out and executing the final punishment of the wicked. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.58055#58055" data-link="1965.58055">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.33437#33437" data-link="1965.33437">Psalms 149:9</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 636.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 636.3</span></p>

By it we are carried back to a new series of events. The whole chapter is but an introduction to the most terrific judgments of the Almighty that ever have been, or are to be, visited upon this earth in its present state; namely, the seven last plagues. The most that we here behold is a solemn preparation for the outpouring of these unmixed vials. Verse 5 shows that these plagues fall after the close of the ministration in the sanctuary; for the temple is opened before they are poured out. They are given in charge to seven angels, and these angels are clothed in linen pure and white, a fit emblem of the purity of God’s righteousness and justice in the infliction of these judgments. They receive these vials from one of the four beasts, or living creatures. These living beings were proved (see on chapter 4) to be a class of Christ’s assistants in his sanctuary work. How appropriate, then, that they should be the ones to deliver to the ministers of vengeance the vials of wrath to be poured upon those who have slighted Christ’s mercy, abused his long-suffering, heaped contumely upon his name, and crucified him afresh in the treatment of his followers! While the seven angels are performing their fearful mission, the temple is filled with the glory of God, and no man — οὐδεὶς<em> </em>(<em>oudeis</em>), no one, no being, referring to Christ and his heavenly assistants — can enter therein. This shows that the work of mercy is closed, as there is no ministration in the sanctuary during the infliction of the plagues; hence they are manifestations of the wrath of God without any mixture of mercy.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 638.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 638.3</span></p>

And as we have no evidence that it has yet changed its location, and the saints are seen upon it, we have here indubitable proof, in connection with chapter 14:1-5, that the saints are taken to heaven to receive a portion of their reward. Thus, like the bright sun bursting through the midnight cloud, some scene is presented, or some promise given, to the humble followers of the Lamb, in every hour of temptation, as if to assure and reassure them of God’s love and care for them, and of the certainty of their final reward. Verily the words of the prophet are among the true sayings of God: “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him;” but “Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him.” <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.36142#36142" data-link="1965.36142">Isaiah 3:10, 11</a>.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 639.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 639.1</span></p>

How comprehensive in its terms! how sublime in its theme! It appeals to the works of God which are a manifestation of his glory. With immortal vision the saints will be able to comprehend them as they cannot here; and yet astronomy reveals enough to fill all hearts with admiration. From our little world we pass out to our sun ninety-three million miles away; on to its nearest neighboring sun, nineteen thousand million miles away; on to the great double pole-star, from which it takes light in its electric flight of one hundred and ninety-two thousand miles a second, forty years to reach our world; on past systems, groups, constellations, till we reach the great star Alcyone, in the Pleiades, shining with a power of twelve thousand suns like ours! What, then, must be the grand center around which these myriads of shining orbs revolve! Well may the song be raised, “Great and marvelous are thy works.” But the song covers another field also — the field of God’s providence and grace: “Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.” All the dealings of God with all his creatures in the eyes of the redeemed, and the sight of all worlds, will be forever vindicated. After all our blindness, all our perplexities, all our trials, we shall be able to exclaim at last in the exuberance of satisfied joy, “Just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 640.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 640.1</span></p>

This is conclusive proof that these judgments are not poured out till after this angel closes his work, and that the very class who hear his warning, and reject it, are the ones to receive the first drops from the overflowing vials of God’s indignation. Now, if these plagues are in the past, the image of the beast and his worship are in the past. If these are past, the two-horned beast, which makes this image, and his work, are in the past. If these are past, then the third angel’s message, which warns us in reference to this work, is in the past; and if this is past, — that is, ages in the past, where this view locates the commencement of the plagues, — then the first and second messages, which precede that, were also ages in the past. Then the prophetic periods, on which the messages are based, especially the 2300 days, ended ages ago. And if this is so, the seventy weeks of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.44867#44867" data-link="1965.44867">Daniel 9</a> are thrown wholly into the Jewish dispensation, and the great proof of the Messiahship of Christ is destroyed. But it has been shown on chapters 7, 13, and 14, that the first and second messages have been given in our own day; that the third is now in process of accomplishment; that the two-horned beast has come upon the stage of action, and is preparing to do the work assigned him; and that the formation of the image and the enforcement of the worship are just in the future. And unless all these positions can be overthrown, the seven last plagues must also be assigned wholly to the future.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 641.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 641.3</span></p>

Another and more definite testimony as to the commencement and duration of these plagues is found in chapter 15:8: “And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.” The temple here introduced is evidently that which is mentioned in chapter 11:19, where it says, “The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.” In other words, we have before us the heavenly sanctuary. The testimony is, then, that when the seven angels with the seven golden vials receive their commission, the temple is filled with smoke from the glory of God, and no being can enter into the temple, or sanctuary, till they have fulfilled their work; there will therefore be no ministration in the sanctuary during this time. Consequently, these vials are not poured out till the close of the ministration in the tabernacle above, but immediately follow that event; for Christ is then no longer a mediator; mercy, which has long stayed the hand of vengeance, pleads no more; the servants of God are all sealed. What could then be expected but that the “storm of vengeance should fall,” and earth be swept with the besom of destruction?</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 643.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 643.1</span></p>

The answer is obvious. For what is the way of these kings to be prepared? Answer: To come up to the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Where is the battle to be fought? — Near Jerusalem. (Joel and Zephaniah.) But Jerusalem is in the hands of the Turks; they hold possession of the land of Palestine and the sacred sepulchers. This is the bone of contention; on these the nations have fixed their covetous and jealous eyes. But though Turkey now possesses them, and others want them, it is nevertheless thought necessary to the tranquillity of Europe that Turkey should be maintained in her position, in order to preserve what is called the “balance of power.” For this the Christian nations of Europe have cooperated to sustain the integrity of the sultan’s throne, because they cannot agree as to the division of the spoils, when Turkey falls. By their sufferance alone that government now exists, and when they shall withdraw their support, and leave it to itself, as they will do under the sixth plague, that symbolic river will be wholly dried up; Turkey will be no more, and the way will be all open for the nations to make their last grand rally to the Holy Land. The kings of the East, the nationalities, powers, and kingdoms lying east of Palestine, will act a conspicuous part in the matter; for Joel says in reference to this scene, “Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat.” The millions of Mohammedans of Persia, Afghanistan, Toorkistan, and India will rush to the field of conquest in behalf of their religion.

It is hardly necessary to reply, The event that takes place under the sixth vial is the <em>entire</em> and <em>utter</em> consumption of that power, not its <em>preliminary</em> state of decay, which is all that now appears. It is necessary that the empire should for a time grow weak and powerless, in order to its utter dissolution when the plague shall come.

The agency now already abroad in the world, known as modern Spiritualism, is every way a fitting means to be employed in this work. But it may be asked how a work which is already going on, can be designated by that expression, when the spirits are not introduced into the prophecy until the pouring out of the sixth plague, which is still future. We answer that in this, as in many other movements, the agencies which Heaven designs to employ in the accomplishment of certain ends, go through a process of preliminary training for the part which they are to act. Thus, before the spirits can have such absolute authority over the race as to gather them to battle against the King of kings and Lord of lords, they must first win their way among the nations of the earth, and cause their teaching to be received as of divine authority, and their word as law. This work they are now doing; and when they shall have once gained full influence over the nations in question, what fitter instruments could be employed to gather them to so rash and hopeless an enterprise?</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 649.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 649.2</span></p>

That this apostate woman, as presented in this chapter, is a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church, is generally believed by Protestants. Between this church and the kings of the earth there has been illicit connection, and with the wine of her fornication, or her false doctrines, the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 657.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 657.2</span></p>

Why, then, should he be astonished, as he looked forward, and saw Rome still persecuting the saints? The secret of his wonder was just this: all the persecution he had witnessed had been from pagan Rome, the open enemy of Christ.

A wild beast, like the one thus introduced, is the symbol of an oppressive and persecuting power; and while the Roman power as a nation had a long, uninterrupted existence, it passed through certain phases during which this symbol would be inapplicable to it, and during which time, consequently, the beast, in such prophecies as the present, might be said not to be, or not to exist. Thus Rome in its pagan form was a persecuting power in its relation to the people of God, during which time it constituted the beast that was; but the empire was nominally converted to Christianity; there was a transition from paganism to another phase of religion falsely called Christian; and during a brief period, while this transition was going on, it lost its ferocious and persecuting character, and then it could be said of the beast that it was not. Time passed on, and it degenerated into popery, and again assumed its bloodthirsty and oppressive character, and then it constituted the beast that “yet is,” or in John’s day was to be.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 659.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 659.2</span></p>

The seven forms of government that have existed in the Roman empire are usually enumerated as follows: (1) kingly; (2) consular; (3) decemvirate; (4) dictatorial; (5) triumvirate; (6) imperial; and (7) papal. Kings, consuls, decemvirs, dictators, and triumvirs had passed away in John’s day. He was living under the imperial form. Two more were to arise after his time. One was only to continue a short space, and hence is not usually reckoned among the heads; while the last, which is usually denominated the seventh, is in reality the eighth. The head which was to succeed the imperial, and continue a <em>short space</em>, could not be the papal; for that has continued longer than all the rest put together. We understand, therefore, that the papal head is the eighth, and that a head of short continuance intervened between the imperial and papal. In fulfillment of this, we read that after the imperial form had been abolished, there was a ruler who for about the space of sixty years governed Rome under the title of the “Exarch of Ravenna.” Thus we have the connecting link between the imperial and papal heads. The third phase of the beast that was, and is not, and yet is, is the Roman power under the rule of the papacy; and in this form it ascends out of the bottomless pit, or bases its power on pretensions which have no foundation but a mixture of Christian errors and pagan superstitions.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 659.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 659.3</span></p>

(See under verse 4.) The consideration of a few facts will guide us unmistakably to the application. In chapter 14 we had a message announcing the fall of Babylon. Babylon is a term which embraces not only the Roman Catholic Church, but religious bodies which have sprung from her, bringing many of her errors and traditions along with them.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 663.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 663.2</span></p>

The fall is therefore a moral one; for the result of it is that Babylon becomes the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. These are terrible descriptions of apostasy, showing that, as a consequence of her fall, she piles up an accumulation of sins even to the heavens, and becomes subject to the judgments of God, which can no longer be delayed.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 663.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 663.3</span></p>

And further, as this fall is said to occur but a short period before Babylon’s final destruction, certainly this side of the rise and predicted triumph of the papal church, this testimony cannot apply to any religious organizations but such as have sprung from that church. These started out on reform. They ran well for a season, and had the approbation of God; but fencing themselves about with creeds, they have failed to keep pace with the advancing light of prophetic truth, and hence have been left in a position where they will finally develop a character as evil and odious in the sight of God as that of the church from which they first withdrew as dissenters, or reformers.

When may this movement be looked for? If the position here taken is correct, that these churches, this branch of Babylon, experienced a moral fall by the rejection of the first message of chapter 14, the announcement in the chapter under consideration could not have gone forth previous to that time. It is, then, either synchronous with the message of the fall of Babylon, in chapter 14, or it is given at a later period than that. But it cannot be synonymous with that; for that merely announces the fall of Babylon, while this adds several particulars which at that time were neither fulfilled nor in process of fulfilment. As we are therefore to look this side of 1844, where the previous message went forth, for the announcement brought to view in this chapter, we inquire, Has any such message been given from that time to the present? The answer must still be in the negative; hence this message is yet future. But we are now having the third angel’s message, which is the last to be given before the coming of the Son of man. We are therefore held to the conclusion that the first two verses of this chapter constitute a feature of the third message which is to appear when this message shall be proclaimed with power, and the whole earth be lightened with its glory.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 666.5 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 666.5</span></p>

Keeping in the background its grosser principles, which it has heretofore carried so largely in the front, it now assumes to appear as respectably religious in some quarters as any other denomination in the land. It talks of sin, repentance, the atonement, salvation through Christ, etc., almost as orthodoxly as the most approved standards. Under the guise of this profession, what is to hinder it from intrenching itself in almost every denomination in Christendom? The basis of Spiritualism is a fundamental dogma in the creeds of almost all the churches. Its secret principles are, alas! too commonly cherished, and its dark practices too commonly followed, to put them at variance on that ground, so long as they seek a common concealment. What, then, can save Christendom from its seductive influence? Herein is seen another sad result of rejecting the truths offered to the world by the messages of chapter 14. Had the churches received these messages, they would have been shielded against this delusion; for among the great truths developed by the religious movement there brought to view, is the important doctrine that the soul of man is not naturally immortal; that eternal life is a gift suspended on conditions, and to be acquired through Christ alone; that the dead are unconscious; and that the rewards and punishments of the future world lie beyond the resurrection and the day of Judgment. This strikes a death-blow to the first and vital claim of Spiritualism. What foothold can that doctrine secure in any mind fortified by this truth? The spirit comes, and claims to be the disembodied soul, or spirit, of a dead man. It is met with the fact that that is not the kind of soul, or spirit, which man possesses; that the “dead know not anything;” that this, its first pretension, is a lie, and that the credentials it offers, show it to belong to the synagogue of Satan. Thus it is at once rejected, and the evil it would do is effectually prevented. But the great mass of religionists stand opposed to the truth which would thus shield them, and thereby expose themselves to this last manifestation of satanic cunning.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 667.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 667.2</span></p>

The infidelity of the present age, under the seductive names of “science,” “the higher criticism,” “evolution,” etc., is making not a few notable converts. As typical cases, we may mention such men as the late Henry Ward Beecher, and such papers as <em>The Outlook</em>, formerly the <em>Christian Union</em>. Mr. Beecher was considered a leader of thought in the religious world, and his fame and influence were not confined to one hemisphere. He became very outspoken in his denial of doctrines which have been considered by all believers in the Bible as among the fundamental truths of revelation. As an illustration, we quote the following from the <em>National Baptist</em> of Sept. 6, 1883. It is from a reply by Mr. Beecher to J. S. Kennard, D.

Men have not fallen as a race; men have come up. No great disaster met the race at the start. The creative decree of God was fulfilled, and any theory of atonement must be one which shall meet the fact that man was created at the lowest point, and, as I believe, is, as to his physical being, evolved from the animal race below him; but as to his moral and spiritual nature, is a son of God, a new element having come in, in the great movement of evolution at the point of man’s appearance.”</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 669.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 669.1</span></p>

They must be relegated to the realm of fable. And when professed ministers of the gospel, to whom the people look for instruction, and on whose views they depend in these matters, lead out with such teaching, what reverence for the word of God can be expected from the masses? “Like priest, like people.” Such ministers are doing more for the cause of infidelity than all the Voltaires and Paines of a past age have done, or all the Ingersolls of the present age are doing.

Much of the body of modern dogmatic theology may be classified under two heads, — funguses and fossils; and whatever declarations of Scripture do not agree with these conceptions, are set down as incorrect. Paul, they say, held erroneous ideas on a number of questions, more especially in reference to the second coming of Christ; and one learned doctor of divinity, as quoted without dissent in a leading religious journal, has asserted that even Christ himself misapprehended the question he was discussing, according to the record of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.48912#48912" data-link="1965.48912">Matthew 24</a>!

And Heaven is not to let all this pass in silence; for a mighty proclamation is to be made, calling the attention of all the world to the fearful counts in the indictment against these unfaithful religious bodies, that the justice of the judgments that follow may plainly appear.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 670.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 670.1</span></p>

The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the <em>abundance</em> of her delicades. Who take the lead in all the extravagances of the age? Who load their tables with the richest and choicest viands? Who are foremost in extravagance in dress, and all costly attire?

Soon Babylon will become so thoroughly leavened with the influence of these evil agents that her condition will be fully manifest to all the honest in heart, and the way be all prepared for the work which the apostle now introduces.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 671.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 671.1</span></p>

How marked becomes the interposition of Heaven, and how the agents for the accomplishment of God’s work multiply, as the great crisis approaches! This voice from heaven is called “another” voice, showing that a new agency is here introduced. We now have five celestial messengers expressly mentioned as engaged in this last religious reformation. These are the first, second, and third angels of chapter 14; fourth, the angel of verse one of this chapter; and fifth, the agency indicated by the “voice” of verse 4, now before us. Three of these are already in operation. The second angel has joined the first, and the third has joined them. The first and second have not ceased. All three now have the field. The angel of verse 1, is entering upon his mission, as the conditions which call for his work are supplied; and the divine call from heaven must take place in connection with his work.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 671.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 671.3</span></p>

An idea of its extent and power may be gathered from the description of the angel there given. The first message is said to go with a “loud voice;” the same is also said of the third message; but this angel, instead of simply flying “in the midst of heaven,” like the others, is said to “<em>come down</em> from heaven.” He comes, as it were, nearer to the earth, with a message more pointed and direct; and he has “great power,” and the earth is “lightened with his glory.” No such description of a message from heaven to man is elsewhere to be found in all the Bible. This is the last; and as is meet, it comes with surpassing glory and unwonted power. It is an awful hour when a world’s destiny is to be decided, — a most solemn crisis when an entire contemporaneous generation of the human family is to pass the bounds of probation, as the last note of mercy is sounded in their ears. In such a time, the world must not be left without warning. So amply must the great fact be heralded, that none can plead a reasonable ignorance of the impending doom. Every excuse must be taken away. The justice and long-suffering and forbearance of God in delaying threatened vengeance till all have had an opportunity to receive a knowledge of his will, and space to repent, must be vindicated. An angel is sent forth, panoplied with Heaven’s power. The light that encircles the throne enshrouds him. He comes to the earth. None but the spiritually dead — yea, “twice dead, and plucked up by the roots” — will fail to realize his presence. Light flashes everywhere. The dark places are lighted up. And while his presence dispels the shadows, his voice in thunder tones utters a warning. He cries “mightily.” He speaks in no feeble tones, and with no uncertain sound. It is no parlor announcement, but a <em>cry</em>, a <em>mighty</em> cry, a cry with a <em>strong voice</em>. The fatal defects in the profession of a worldly church are again pointed out. Their errors are once more, and for the last time, exposed. The inadequacy of the present standard of godliness to meet the final crisis is emphasized beyond all mistaking. The inevitable connection between their cherished errors and irretrievable and everlasting destruction, is heralded till the earth resounds with the cry. Meanwhile, great Babylon’s sins mount up to the heavens, and the remembrance of her iniquities comes up before God. The storm of vengeance gathers. The great tidal wave of supernal wrath rolls onward. The feathery foam plays along its crest, indicating that but an instant remains ere it will burst upon the great city of confusion, and proud Babylon will go down as a millstone sinks in the depths of the sea. Suddenly another voice rings out from heaven, “Come out of her, my people!” The humble, sincere, devoted children of God, of whom there are some still left, and who sigh and cry over the abominations done in the land, heed the voice, wash their hands of her sins, separate from her communion, escape, and are saved, while Babylon becomes the victim of the just judgments of God. There are stirring times before the church. Let us be ready for the crisis.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 672.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 672.1</span></p>

Bear in mind that this testimony applies to that portion of Babylon which is subject to a moral fall. As already pointed out, it must apply especially to the “daughters,” the denominations who persist in clinging to the personal traits of the “mother,” and keeping up the family resemblance. These, as pointed out on a previous page, are to attempt a sweeping persecution against the truth and the people of God. By these the “image of the beast” is to be formed. These are to have what will be to them a new experience, — the use of the civil arm to enforce their dogmas. And it is doubtless this first intoxication of power that leads this branch of Babylon to cherish in her heart the boast, “I sit a queen, and am no widow;” that is, I am no longer χήρα, “one bereaved,” or destitute of power, as I have been; but now I rule like a queen; I shall see no sorrow; God is in the Constitution; the church is enthroned, and shall henceforth bear sway. The expression, “Reward her even as she rewarded you,” seems to show that the time for this message to be given, and for the saints to be called out, will be when she begins to raise against them the arm of oppression. As she fills up the cup of persecution to the saints, so the angel of the Lord will persecute her (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.29367#29367" data-link="1965.29367">Psalms 35:6</a>); and judgments from on high will bring upon her, in a twofold degree, the evil which she thought to bring upon the humble servants of the Lord.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 673.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 673.2</span></p>

Look at the occurrences of more recent times. The year 1882 was considered a phenomenal and fatal year; but the disasters of the first seven months of 1883 overbalanced those of the whole year preceding. In January, one hundred and ten persons perished by floods and fires; in February, one hundred and twenty-seven by floods; in March, eleven by fire; in April, three hundred and four by tornadoes; in May, one hundred and thirty-two by the Brooklyn-bridge panic and by tornadoes; in June, fifty-eight by tornadoes and floods; in July, one hundred and one by disasters. The foregoing casualties occurred in this country. In the Old World, the fatalities were still more appalling. There, during the same time, two thousand two hundred and sixty-three persons perished by floods, fires, and other disasters. To mention some, in India and Egypt, nearly twenty-two thousand fell victims to the cholera. Then comes the earthquake at Ischia, Italy, July 28, with nine thousand victims, and the volcanic eruptions and subaqueous earthquake of Java, August 26, in which a tract of country fifty miles square, containing a range of mountains sixty-five miles in length, sunk below the level of the ocean, whose waters rushed in, and now cover all that space. Islands also in the adjacent straits of Sunda disappeared, and in all one hundred thousand persons are supposed to have perished. This gives the appalling aggregate of over one hundred and thirty thousand persons who perished by violent deaths, chiefly through disturbances of the elements and the convulsions of nature, during that fateful year. And similar disturbances have followed with more or less severity in subsequent years. Look at the disastrous earthquakes in Japan in 1896, in which more than ten thousand persons lost their lives, and the panic in which thousands of Russian peasants perished at the coronation of the czar, in the same year.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 677.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 677.1</span></p>

This destruction takes place, and this song is sung, in connection with the second coming of Christ at the commencement of the thousand years.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 680.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 680.2</span></p>

Does not this language imply eternity of suffering? Let it be remembered that this is borrowed language; and to gain a correct understanding of it, we must go back to its first introduction, and consider its import as there used. In <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.37347#37347" data-link="1965.37347">Isaiah 34</a> will be found the language from which, in all probability, such expressions as these are borrowed. Under the figure of Idumea, a certain destruction is brought to view; and it is said of that land that its streams should be turned into pitch, its dust into brimstone, that it should become burning pitch, and not be quenched night nor day, but that its smoke should go up forever. Now this language is spoken, as all must concede, of one of two things; either of the particular country called Idumea, or of the whole earth under that name. In either case it is evident that the language must be limited. Probably the whole earth is meant, from the fact that the chapter opens with an address to the earth and all that is therein, the world and all that come forth of it; and the indignation of the Lord is declared to be upon all nations. Now, whether this refers to the depopulation and desolation of the earth at the second advent, or to the purifying fires that shall purge it of the effects of the curse at the end of the thousand years, the language must still be limited; for after all this, a renovated earth is to come forth, to be the abode of the nations of the saved throughout eternity. Three times this expression of smoke going up forever is used in the Bible: once here in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.37347#37347" data-link="1965.37347">Isaiah 34</a>, of the land of Idumea as a figure of the earth; in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63104#63104" data-link="1965.63104">Revelation 14</a> (which see), of the worshipers of the beast and his image; and again in the chapter we are now considering, referring to the destruction of great Babylon; and all of them apply to the very same time, and describe the same scenes; namely, the destruction visited upon this earth, the worshipers of the beast, and all the pomp of great Babylon, at the second advent of our Lord and Saviour.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 680.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 680.3</span></p>

A vast field for thought is here opened, and material furnished for a more lengthy exposition than falls within the design of this work. The Lamb’s wife is the New Jerusalem which is above. This will be noticed more fully on chapter 21. The marriage of the Lamb is his reception of this city. When he receives this city, he receives it as the glory and metropolis of his kingdom; hence with it he receives his kingdom, and the throne of his father David. This may well be the event designated by the marriage of the Lamb. That the marriage relation is often taken to illustrate the union between Christ and his people, is granted; but the marriage of the Lamb here spoken of is a definite event to take place at a definite time; and if the declaration that Christ is the head of the church as the husband is the head of the wife (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59808#59808" data-link="1965.59808">Ephesians 5:23</a>), proves that the church is now the Lamb’s wife, then the marriage of the Lamb took place long ago; but that cannot be, according to this scripture, which locates it in the future. Paul told his Corinthian converts that he had espoused them to one husband, even Christ. This is true of all converts. But while this figure is used to denote the relation that they then assumed to Christ, was it a fact that the marriage of the Lamb took place in Corinth in Paul’s day, and that it has been going on for the past eighteen hundred years? Further remarks on this point are deferred to a consideration of chapter 21.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 682.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 682.1</span></p>

(See a notable instance in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.32260#32260" data-link="1965.32260">Psalms 114</a>.) Again, the query may arise on verse 8 how a city can be arrayed in the righteousness of the saints; but if we consider that a city without inhabitants would be but a dreary and cheerless place, we see at once how this is. Reference is had to the countless number of its glorified inhabitants in their shining apparel. The raiment was <em>granted</em> to her. What is granted to her? <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.38207#38207" data-link="1965.38207">Isaiah 54</a> and <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59450#59450" data-link="1965.59450">Galatians 4:21-31</a> will explain.

The mistake which such persons make on this scripture is in supposing that the angel declares to John that he is one of the old prophets come back to communicate with him. The person employed in giving the Revelation to John is called an angel, and angels are not the departed spirits of the dead. Whoever takes the position that they are, is to all intents a Spiritualist; for this is the very foundation-stone of their theory. But the angel says no such thing. He simply says that he is the fellow servant of John, as he had been the fellow servant of his brethren the prophets. The term <em>fellow servant</em> implies that they were all on a common footing as servants of the great God; hence he was not a proper object for John to worship.

We are here carried back to the second coining of Christ, this time under the symbol of a warrior riding forth to battle. Why is he represented thus? — Because he is going forth to war, — to meet “the kings of the earth and their armies,” and this would be the only proper character in which to represent him on such a mission. His vesture is dipped in blood. (See a description of the same scene in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.38502#38502" data-link="1965.38502">Isaiah 63:1-4</a>.) The armies of heaven, the angels of God, follow him. Verse 15 shows how he rules the nations with a rod of iron, when they are given him for an inheritance, as recorded in the second psalm, which popular theology interprets to mean the conversion of the world. But would not such expressions as “treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God,” be a very singular description of a work of grace upon the hearts of the heathen for their conversion? The great and final display of the “winepress of God’s wrath,” and also of “the lake of fire,” occurs at the end of the thousand years, as described in chapter 20; and to that it would seem that the full and formal description of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63138#63138" data-link="1965.63138">Revelation 14:18-20</a> must apply. But the destruction of the living wicked at the second coming of Christ, at the beginning of the thousand years, furnishes a scene on a smaller scale, similar, in both these respects, to what takes place at the close of that period. Hence in the verses before us we have this mention of both the winepress of wrath and the lake of fire.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 684.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 684.2</span></p>

This is in harmony with the character in which he here appears; for it was the custom of warriors anciently to have some kind of title inscribed upon their vesture. Verse 17. What is to be understood by the angel standing in the sun? In chapter 16:17, we read of the seventh vial being poured out into the air, from which it was inferred that as the air envelops the whole earth, that plague would be universal. May not the same principle of interpretation apply here, and show that the angel standing in the sun, and issuing his call from thence to the fowls of heaven to come to the supper of the great God, denotes that this proclamation will go wherever the sun’s rays fall upon this earth? And the fowls will be obedient to the call, and fill themselves with the flesh of horses, kings, captains, and mighty men. Thus, while the saints are partaking of the marriage supper of the Lamb, the wicked in their own persons furnish a great supper for the fowls of heaven.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 685.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 685.1</span></p>

A bright ray of light is thrown from the old typical service directly upon this passage. Thus, Christ is the great High Priest of this dispensation. On the day of atonement, anciently, two goats were taken by the priest, upon which lots were cast, one for the Lord, and the other for the scape-goat. The one upon which the Lord’s lot fell, was then slain, and his blood carried into the sanctuary to make an -atonement for the children of Israel, after which the sins of the people were confessed upon the head of the other, or scapegoat, and he was sent away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness, or a place not inhabited. Now, as Christ is the priest of this dispensation, so by arguments, a few of which we here introduce, Satan is shown to be the antitypical scape-goat.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 687.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 687.3</span></p>

On this verse, Jenks, in his Comprehensive Commentary, remarks: “Scape-goat. (See diff. opin. in Bochart.) Spencer, after the oldest opinion of the Hebrews and Christians, thinks <em>Azazel is the name of the devil</em>; and so Rosenmüller, whom see. The Syriac has <em>Azzail</em>, the angel (strong one) who revolted.” The Devil is here evidently pointed out. Thus we have the definition of the Scripture term in two ancient languages, with the oldest opinion of the Christians, in favor of the view that the scape-goat is a type of Satan.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 688.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 688.1</span></p>

The Septuagint, or oldest Greek version, renders it by ἀποπομπαῖος (<em>apopompaios</em>), a word applied by the Greeks to a malign deity sometimes appeased by sacrifices. Another confirmation is found in the book of Enoch, where the name Azalzel, evidently a corruption of Azazel, is given to one of the fallen angels, thus plainly showing what was the prevalent understanding of the Jews at that day.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 688.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 688.2</span></p>

The voice of God has shaken it to its foundations; the islands and mountains have been moved out of their places; the great earthquake has leveled to the earth the mightiest works of man; the seven last plagues have left their all-desolating footprints over the earth; the burning glory attending the coming of the Son of man has borne its part in accomplishing the general desolation; the wicked have been given to the slaughter, and their putrefying flesh and bleaching bones lie unburied, ungathered, and unlamented from one end of the earth to the other end thereof.

His sphere of action is circumscribed, he being at this time confined to this earth; and thus is he bound, being condemned throughout this period to a state of hopeless inactivity.

Over this exposition some assume to grow merry, telling us that we have mistaken the parties, and have the wicked bound, not the Devil. Yet how often do we hear, in the daily transactions of life, such expressions as these: My way was completely hedged up; my hands were completely tied, etc. But do we understand, when persons use such expressions, that some insurmountable obstacle was literally thrown across the path they were traveling, or that their hands were literally confined with ropes or cords? — No; but simply that a combination of circumstances rendered it impossible for them to act. Just so here; and why will not people grant to the Bible the same liberty of speech that they give, without question and without ridicule, to their fellow men in the common intercourse of life? But more than this, there is here a great limitation of Satan’s power, which may well be called a “binding.” He no longer has the power of traversing space, and visiting other worlds; but like man he is confined to this earth, which he nevermore leaves. The place of the ruin he has wrought now becomes his gloomy prison-house, till he is led out to execution, at the end of the thousand years.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 691.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 691.2</span></p>

The Devil deceives them, and thus brings them up to this battle. They are induced to commence an impious warfare upon the holy city, in prospect of some advantage to be gained by fighting against the saints.

The word here rendered <em>devoured</em>, Professor Stuart admits is “intensive,” and signifies, “to eat up, devour, so that it denotes utter excision.” (Hudson’s Christ our Life, p. 146.)

It will be noticed that in the expression, “where the beast and false prophet are,” <em>are</em> is a supplied word. It would be more proper to supply the words <em>were cast</em>, answering to what was spoken of the Devil just before. The sentence would then read, “The Devil was cast into the lake of fire, where the beast and false prophet <em>were cast</em>.” The beast and false prophet were cast in there, and destroyed, at the commencement of the thousand years. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63329#63329" data-link="1965.63329">Revelation 19:20</a>.

The Scriptures declare that they shall be rewarded according to their deeds. There are, then, to be degrees in the punishment of the wicked; and it may be asked how this can be harmonized with the view that death is the punishment for sin, and comes upon all alike. Let us ask believers in eternal misery how they will maintain degrees in <em>their</em> system. They tell us the intensity of the pain endured will be in each case proportioned to the guilt of the sufferer. But how can this be? Are not the flames of hell equally severe in all parts? and will they not equally affect <em>all</em> the immaterial souls cast therein? But God can interpose, it is answered, to produce the effect desired. Very well, then, we reply, cannot he also interpose, if necessary, and graduate the pain which will attend the infliction of death upon the sinner as the climax of his penalty? So, then, our view is equal with the common one in this respect, while it possesses great advantages over it in another; for while that has to find its degrees of punishment in intensity of pain alone, the duration in all cases being the same, this may not only have degrees in pain but in duration also; inasmuch as some may perish in a short space of time, and the weary sufferings of others be long drawn out. But yet we apprehend that the bodily suffering will be but an unnoticed trifle compared with the mental agony, that keen anguish which will rack their souls as they get a view of their incomparable loss, each according to his capacity of appreciation. The youth who had but little more than reached the years of accountability, being less able to comprehend his situation and his loss, will of course feel it less; to him of older years, more capacity, and consequently a deeper experience in sin, the burden of his fate will be proportionately greater; while the man of giant intellect and almost boundless comprehension, — who hence possessed greater influence for evil, and so was the more guilty for devoting his powers to the service of that evil, — being able to understand his situation fully, comprehend his fate, and realize his loss, will feel it most keenly of all. Into <em>his</em> soul the iron will indeed enter most intolerably deep. And thus, by an established law of mind, the sufferings of each may be most accurately adjusted to the magnitude of his guilt.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 699.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 699.3</span></p>

Some have supposed that when the Bible speaks of the third heaven, in which are paradise and the tree of life (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59188#59188" data-link="1965.59188">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62686#62686" data-link="1965.62686">Revelation 2:7</a>), it refers to the heaven which is yet future, and does not prove that there is a paradise and tree of life literally in existence in heaven at the present time. They base their view on the fact that Peter speaks of three heavens and earths, — (1) those before the flood, (2) the ones which now are, and (3) the ones which are to come. But that theory is completely overturned by the <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63342#63342" data-link="1965.63342">first verse</a> of <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63365#63365" data-link="1965.63365">Revelation 21</a>; for John here reckons but two heavens and earths. The ones which now are he calls the <em>first</em>, so that the future new heavens would, according to this count, be the <em>second</em>, and not the <em>third</em>, as Peter reckons. Hence it is certain that Peter did not design to establish a numerical order, in accordance with which we should speak of the one as the first, the other as the second, and the last as the third. The object of his reasoning was simply to show that as a literal heaven and earth succeeded to the destruction of the earth by the flood, so a literal heaven and earth would result from the renovation of the present system by fire. There is no proof, therefore, that the Bible, when it speaks of the third heaven, refers simply to the third state of the present heavens and earth, for then all the Bible writers would uniformly have so reckoned it. Thus the arguments of those who would endeavor to disprove the idea of a literal paradise and tree of life in existence at the present time, fall to the ground. The Bible certainly recognizes three heavens in the present constitution of things; namely, the first, or atmospheric heaven, which the fowls of the air inhabit; the second, the planetary heaven, the region of the sun, moon, and stars; and the third, high above the others, where paradise and the tree of life are found (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.62686#62686" data-link="1965.62686">Revelation 2:7</a>); where God has his residence and his throne (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63420#63420" data-link="1965.63420">Revelation 22:1, 2</a>); to which Paul was caught up in heavenly vision (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59188#59188" data-link="1965.59188">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>); to which Christ ascended when he left the earth (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63040#63040" data-link="1965.63040">Revelation 12:5</a>); where he now, as priest-king, sits upon the throne with his Father (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.46878#46878" data-link="1965.46878">Zechariah 6:13</a>); and where the glorious city stands, awaiting the saints when they enter into life. <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.63367#63367" data-link="1965.63367">Revelation 21:2</a>.

The great God takes up his abode on this earth; but we do not suppose that God is confined to this, or any other one of the worlds of his creation. He here has a throne, and the earth enjoys so much of his presence that it may be said that he dwells among men. And why should this be thought a strange thing? God’s only begotten Son is here as ruler of his special kingdom; the holy city, which is called the Father’s house, and which it is natural to suppose will be the most beautiful and glorious object in the universe, will be here; and the heavenly hosts take an interest in this world probably above what they feel in any other; yea, reasoning from one of the Saviour’s parables, there will be more joy in heaven over one world redeemed than over ninety and nine which have needed no redemption.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 704.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 704.3</span></p>

The figure is first introduced in <a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.38207#38207" data-link="1965.38207">Isaiah 54</a>. The new-covenant city is there brought to view. It is represented as being desolate while the old covenant was in force, and the Lord’s care was confined to the Jews and old Jerusalem; but it is said to her that “the children of the desolate” shall be many more than “the children of the married wife.” It is further said to her, “Thy Maker is thy husband;” and the closing promise of the Lord to this city, contains a very similar description to the one which we have here in Revelation; namely, “I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires; and I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord.” It is this very promise to which Paul refers, and upon which he comments in his Epistle to the Galatians, when he says, “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all” (<a class="link" href="/en/book/1965.59460#59460" data-link="1965.59460">Galatians 4:26</a>); for he quotes, in the next verse, this very prophecy from the book of Isaiah to sustain this declaration. Here, then, Paul makes an inspired application of Isaiah’s prophecy which cannot be mistaken; and in this he shows that under the figure of a “woman,” a “wife” whose “children” were to be multiplied, the Lord by the prophet speaks of the New Jerusalem, the city above, as contrasted with the earthly Jerusalem in the land of Palestine; and of this city the Lord calls himself the “husband.” In addition to this, we have the positive testimony of the twenty-first chapter of Revelation to the same facts.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 707.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 707.2</span></p>

The measure of the city, John declares, was twelve thousand furlongs. Twelve thousand furlongs, eight furlongs to the mile, equal fifteen hundred English miles. It may be understood that this measure is the measure of the whole circumference of the city, and not merely of one side. This appears, from Kitto, to have been the ancient method of measuring cities. The whole circumference was taken, and that was said to be the measure of the city. According to this rule, the New Jerusalem will be three hundred and seventy-five miles on each side. The length, breadth, and hight of it are equal. From this language, the question has arisen whether the city was as high as it was long and broad. The word rendered <em>equal</em> is ἴσος (<em>isos</em>); and from the definitions given by Liddell and Scott, we learn that it may be used to convey the idea of proportion: the hight was proportionate to the length and breadth. And this idea is strengthened by the fact that the wall was only a hundred and forty-four cubits high. Taking the cubit at about twenty-two inches, the length which is most commonly assigned to the ancient cubit, it would give only two hundred and sixty-four feet as the hight of the wall. Now, if the city is just as high as it is long and broad, that is, three hundred and seventy-five miles, this wall of less than three hundred feet would be, in comparison, a most insignificant affair. Probably, therefore, the hight of the buildings of the city is to be judged of by the hight of the wall, which is distinctly given.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 709.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 709.3</span></p>

It seems to us entirely unnecessary to place such a construction upon the language. The word <em>equal</em> does not always mean the same as to dimensions or position; it is frequently used in the sense of proportion. If we were to say that the length and the breadth and the hight of the city were in proportion, we should not violate the language.” This view is taken by Jas. Du Pui, A. M., in his Exposition of the Apocalypse. The following from Thomas Wicks, author of Lectures on the Apocalypse, presents the same idea: “The language, however, will bear another meaning, which is far more natural.

This would give all corresponding parts of the city equal access to the grand avenue. It would also furnish opportunity for one magnificent gate in the center of each side of the city, opening upon the grand avenue. The length of each of these four branches of the avenue (depending of course on how much space is allotted to the throne) would be at least some one hundred and eighty miles. It may be said that this is carrying speculation a degree too far. Perhaps it is. But it is assumed that those who hope soon to enter into that city, will not be averse to a little innocent speculation in that direction.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 717.1 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 717.1</span></p>

It is evident that there is but one tree of life. From Genesis to Revelation it is spoken of as but one — <em>the</em> tree of life. 2. To be at once on both sides of the river, it must have more than one trunk, in which case it must be united at the top or in its upper branches, in order to form but one tree. John, caught away in the Spirit, and presented with a minute view of this wonderful object, says that it was on either side of the river. Another who has been privileged to behold in vision the marvelous glories of the heavenly land, has borne similar testimony: “We all marched in, and felt that we had a perfect right in the city. Here we saw the tree of life and the throne of God. Out of the throne came a pure river of water, and on either side of the river was the tree of life. At first I thought I saw two trees. I looked again, and saw that they were united at the top in one tree. So it was the tree of life on either side of the river of life; its branches bowed to the place where we stood; and the fruit was glorious, which looked like gold mixed with silver.” — <em>Experience and Views</em>, <em>pp.<em> </em>12</em>, <em>13</em>. And why should such a tree be looked upon as unnatural or impossible, since we have an illustration of it here upon earth? The banyan tree of India is of precisely the same nature in this respect. Of this tree the Encyclopedia Americana thus speaks: “The <em>ficus Indica</em> (Indian fig, or banyan tree) has been celebrated from antiquity from its letting its branches drop and take root in the earth, which in their turn become trunks, and give out other branches, a single tree thus forming a little forest.” In just this way the tree of life could extend and support itself.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 717.2 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 717.2</span></p>

Reference can be had only to the ten commandments as delivered on Mount Sinai. He pronounces a blessing upon those who keep them. Thus in the closing chapter of the word of God, and near the very close of the last testimony which the faithful and true Witness there left for his people, he solemnly pronounces a blessing upon those who keep the commandments of God.

But there seems to be good evidence that the first is the original, from which the latter is a variation by the errors of transcribers. Thus the Syriac New Testament, one of the very earliest translations from the original Greek, reads according to the common English version. And Cyprian, whose writings antedate any extant Greek manuscript (Ante-Nicene Library, Vol. XIII, p. 122), quotes the text as reading, “Blessed are they that do his commandments.” We may therefore safely consider this as the genuine reading.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 721.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 721.3</span></p>

Let it be borne in mind that it is the book of this prophecy, or the Revelation, which is the subject of remark; hence the words concerning adding to or taking from have exclusive reference to this book. Nothing can be called an addition to this book except something added to it with the intention of having it considered as a genuine part of the book of Revelation. To take from the book would be to suppress some portion of it. As the book of Revelation could not be called an addition to the book of Daniel, so if God should see fit to make further revelations to us by his Spirit, it would be no addition to the book of Revelation, unless it should claim to be a part of that book.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 725.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 725.3</span></p>

The second coming of Christ is to be the climax and completion of that great scheme. It is most appropriate, therefore, that the book should close with the solemn announcement, “Surely I come quickly.” Be it ours to join with fervent hearts in the response of the apostle, “Amen.

Then shall the elect be gathered, and bid a long farewell to all the ills of this mortal life. How rich in all that is precious to the Christian is this promise! Wandering an exile in this evil world, separated from the few of like precious faith, he longs for the companionship of the righteous, the communion of saints. Here he shall obtain it; for all the good shall be gathered, not from one land only, but from all lands; not from one age only, but from ages, — the great harvest of all the good, coming up in long and glorious procession, while angels shout the harvest home, and the timbrels of heaven sound forth in joyous concert; and a song before unheard, unknown, in the universe, the song of the redeemed, shall add its marvelous notes of rapture and melody to the universal jubilee.

The saints can but sigh and pray for it. Like Job, they cry out for the presence of God. Like David, they cannot be satisfied till they awake in his likeness. In this mortal condition we groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon. We can but be “upon tiptoe” for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body. Our eyes are open for its visions, our ears are waiting to catch the sounds of the heavenly music, and our hearts are beating in anticipation of its infinite joy. Our appetites are growing sharp for the marriage supper. We cry out for the living God, and long to come into his presence. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly. No news more welcome than the announcement that the command has gone forth from the Lord to his angels, Gather together unto me my elect from the four winds of heaven.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 726.3 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 726.3</span></p>

Jesus, the fairest among ten thousand, is there. The throne of God and the Lamb, in the glory of which the sun disappears as the stars vanish in the light of day, is there. The city of jasper and gold, whose builder and maker is God, is there. The river of life, sparkling with the glory of God and flowing from his throne in infinite purity and peace, is there. The tree of life, with its healing leaves and life-giving fruit, is there. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Noah, Job, and Daniel, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, the perfection of heavenly society, will be there. Visions of beauty are there; fields of living green, flowers that never fade, streams that never dry, products in variety that never ends, fruits that never decay, crowns that never dim, harps that know no discord, and all else of which a taste purified from sin and raised to the plane of immortality, can form any conception or think desirable, will be there.</span><span class="egw_refcode" title="Daniel and The Revelation, p. 726.4 (Uriah  Smith)">DAR 726.4</span></p>

O day of rest and triumph, and every good, delay not thy dawning! Let the angels at once be sent to gather the elect.
