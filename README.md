# BibleTools.info

This repository contains the code that powers BibleTools.info, a tool that provides verse-by-verse resources to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the Bible. 
I haven't done too much work on this for a while so the codebase is a bit out of date, but I intend to convert it to a React-based application as soon as I have the chance to do so. If you're interested in contributing to the project, feel free to get in touch.

I only recently made this repository public, so please excuse the brevity, this README is a work in progress.
